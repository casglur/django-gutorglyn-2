		<h2>
			<span class="topHeading">Guto’r
				Glyn: A Life</span>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<span style="font-variant: small-caps">EURIG SALISBURY AND
				BARRY J. LEWIS</span>
		</p>
		<p>Guto’r Glyn has the distinction of being not only one of the
			foremost poets of fifteenth-century Wales, but also the earliest
			Welsh poet for whom it is possible to construct a fairly reliable
			biography. Unlike his most famous predecessor, Dafydd ap Gwilym, Guto
			was a professional praise poet. Rather than devoting himself to
			singing love poems to young women about whom nothing is now known, he
			sang directly to men whose names and deeds are often recorded in
			contemporary documents. Furthermore, Guto had a very long career and
			sang to a number of the most powerful people of the age.</p>
		<p>It is likely, however, that only a relatively small proportion
			of his work has come down to us. Around 120 of his poems survive in
			the manuscripts (a total of 7569 lines), which is a fairly large
			number when compared with most poets of the period, though less
			impressive in relation to the 238 surviving poems of Lewys Glyn
			Cothi, most of them recorded in his own hand. Bearing in mind that
			Guto probably lived longer than Lewys, and assuming that he was no
			less prolific, it is likely that over half his works have been lost.
			Much of what was once known about him has also been forgotten,
			including his place of birth, the identity of his bardic teacher and
			the date of his death.</p>
		<p>Even so, the little that survives offers two remarkable
			features. Firstly there is the long period over which Guto’r Glyn
			sang; most of the fifteenth century, after the Glyndŵr rebellion, is
			represented in his work. Secondly there is the wide geographical
			range of his poetry; as far as is known, the only region of Wales
			where he was not particularly active was the south-west. Though the
			evidence is far from complete, vivid glimpses of Guto that we get at
			particular times and in particular places allow us to piece together
			an outline of the career of a poet of truly national and
			international significance.</p>
		<p class="heading 3">Rediscovering the poet</p>
		<p>
			The first compilation of Guto’s works, <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gwaith Guto’r Glyn</span>, was published
			in 1939 by the University of Wales Press under the editorship of Ifor
			Williams, the poems having been collected by J. Llywelyn Williams. In
			subsequent years there have been several studies of the poet’s life,
			most notably by Saunders Lewis (1976) and J.E. Caerwyn Williams
			(1997). Though these works contain much that is of value, they were
			of necessity based upon a rather inadequate edition of the poetry
			that had been prepared and completed in haste, with the Second World
			War looming (GGl vii). It must now be accepted that much of what has
			been writtten about Guto’s life is riddled with minor
			misapprehensions based on inadequate texts of his poems. The only
			biography written for him (Rees 2008) rests upon the same shaky
			foundations and, furthermore, is guilty of spreading some new
			misapprehensions of its own. The present study, which has the
			advantage of drawing upon the new, more thorough edition of the
			poems, aims to lay to rest some of these past misconceptions and to
			place studies of Guto’s life on a firmer foundation. Even so, much
			uncertainty remains and it is hoped that this study will encourage
			others to address the problems that remain.
		</p>
		<p class="heading 3">The life of a poet in the fifteenth century</p>
		<p>
			Before considering Guto’s career specifically, it is worth outlining
			what is known about the activities of the professional poets of his
			day. Their function, in essence, was to entertain their patrons.
			These were men of varying status, from great noblemen such as William
			Herbert of Raglan, who became the first earl of Pembroke, to minor
			squires such as Phylib ap Gwilym Llwyd of Tregunter. But they were
			all <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span> – men of high
			lineage who owned estates and homes that were comfortable by the
			standards of the age. Some men of this class would pursue a career in
			the Church and, once again, their status would vary. Guto sang to the
			dean of Bangor and to parish priests, and to the abbots of some of
			the Cistercian houses, who also belonged to local <span
				style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span> families. Patronage was
			also provided by women, on occasion, sometimes in partnership with
			their husbands, or else by virtue of their status as widows. Some
			exceptional patrons must also be mentioned, such as John Talbot,
			second earl of Shrewsbury, and above all King Edward IV. It is
			unlikely that these eminent men could speak Welsh, and it could be
			argued that the poems addressed to them were in fact performed for
			their local followers instead; or, if they themselves were indeed
			present at the performance, then they might have been provided with
			an English summary either beforehand or afterwards. In the 1470s Guto
			received payment for services rendered as a minstrel to Edward,
			Prince of Wales, at Shrewsbury, so the possibility that the poems to
			the earl and the king were indeed performed in their presence should
			not be ruled out too hastily.
		</p>
		<p>
			A poet’s main task was to praise his patron in verse. This kind of
			poetry, praise poetry, is so central to the poets’ function that it
			is almost synonymous with their craft. One fairly common name for the
			praise poetry was <span style="font-style: italic">y glod</span> ‘the
			praise’. The verb <span style="font-style: italic">prydu</span> was
			also used. The original meaning of this verb was ‘to form’ or ‘to
			shape’, but it came to mean ‘to compose praise poetry’, specifically.
			There are also references to <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd
				gŵr</span> (literally ‘man’s poem’), while Guto calls himself a <span
				style="font-style: italic">prydydd gŵr</span> ‘man’s poet’. These
			terms embody an important truth about the praise poetry: it is above
			all a celebration of masculinity. The qualities praised are those
			which characterized the ideal man, namely: courage on the
			battlefield; strength in defending his own interests and ensuring the
			wellbeing of his dependants; generosity and kindness towards the
			deserving (such as his own followers, the poets, and guests in
			general); and a commitment to justice and to maintaining order and
			fairness within society. These ideas are expressed clearly in the
			topos <span style="font-style: italic">gwrdd wrth wrdd, gwâr
				wrth wâr</span> ‘fierce to the fierce, gentle to the gentle’ which occurs
			repeatedly in the poetry. The behaviour of the ideal man should vary
			according to the nature of those with whom he interacted. He should
			show strength and audacity or even cruelty towards those who would
			challenge him, but was expected to treat his friends and followers,
			and likewise the weak and defenceless – namely all women and those
			seeking charity – with boundless generosity and a smiling
			countenance. These qualities were closely associated with high
			lineage. In medieval society it was generally believed that it was
			lineage that guaranteed possession of such virtues, as well as
			determining an individual’s right to inherit his family’s land and
			social status. This is why it features so prominently in the praise
			poetry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the themes of the praise poetry are quite narrow and
			repetitive, there is endless variation in the expression of the act
			of praise. No praise poem, whether it be an <span
				style="font-style: italic">awdl</span> (ode) or a <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>, adheres slavishly to a
			pre-existing pattern, and there is variation in the choice of themes,
			the order in which they are presented, the imagery and means of
			expression, and the emphases. Different genres, or sub-genres, can be
			recognised within the praise poetry. Request poems were sung to
			solicit a favour or a gift, either for the poet himself or on behalf
			of a patron, and there were also poems of thanks which showed
			appreciation for such acts of generosity. Other poems were sung to
			celebrate a wedding or the building of a new house. But the most
			important and noteworthy of the sub-genres was the elegy, sung not
			only to commemorate the deceased but also to ensure that the poets’
			source of patronage would continue into the next generation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Entertainment, in the widest sense of the word, is what the praise
			poetry provided. There were also other types of poetry that were not
			so closely connected with the praise of individuals. One means of
			generating amusement was to set poets up to satirize one another.
			Guto took part in several bardic debates (<span
				style="font-style: italic">ymrysonau</span>). The humour in these
			debates was based upon lively exaggeration and the witty, original
			use of imagery. The set topics could be quite near the knuckle, such
			as accusing another poet of exaggeration and of spreading lies, of
			showing a lack of boldness, of being a careless drunkard or of
			suffering from some unpleasant illness. The appearance and
			effectiveness of the sexual organs were not off limits either.
		</p>
		<p>
			Guto’s surviving poetry is noteworthy amongst that of other
			fifteenth-century poets because it is restricted, to all intents and
			purposes, to the genres mentioned above. We do not have any love
			poems or religious verses of his, except for one religious <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> which, as Guto himself
			admits, was sung at the behest of a clerical patron who had
			complained that the poet did not pay sufficient attention to the
			state of his own soul (poem 118). Perhaps Guto was not accustomed to
			concern himself with these genres, though it would be rash to argue
			this on the basis of the proportion of his work that has come down to
			us. He certainly seems to have been familiar with the conventions of
			both religious poetry and love poetry, judging by his poem to the
			priest of Merthyr Tydfil (poem 16), which portrays the relationship
			between him and his (female) patron saint as if it were a love
			affair, and the light-hearted <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
			concerning the love of Gwladus of Glyn-nedd (poem 34).
		</p>
		<p>The practical aspects of the poets’ craft are very difficult to
			recreate today from the inadequate evidence that has survived. There
			is a temptation to turn to sixteenth-century documents, which say
			more about the work, organization and rules of the bardic order, but
			it is difficult to know how reliable this material is when applied to
			the fifteenth century. It is safer to rely upon the evidence of Guto
			and his contemporaries.</p>
		<p>We do not know how a man came to be a poet in fifteenth-century
			Wales. It is clear that some poets followed family tradition, such as
			the sons of Hywel Swrdwal, Tudur Penllyn and Huw Cae Llwyd. But we
			have no evidence that Guto’s father had followed the same profession
			as his son, and this is also true of many other poets. The poets’
			education is a huge gap in our knowledge, and the little that can be
			gathered, or rather guessed, is discussed below. We also do not know
			how a poet would go about developing his network of patrons when he
			first started out, though the likelihood is that he was expected to
			follow his master from house to house before venturing forth on his
			own.</p>
		<p>
			Professional poets spent a lot of time on the road and sometimes sang
			of the tribulations they endured whilst travelling. They would visit
			their patrons on three regular occasions during the year, namely
			Christmas, Easter and Whitsun – the three special feasts that are
			often mentioned. Poets would also visit on saints’ days, particularly
			on the festival of the parish’s patron saint. Other events that might
			occasion a visit were weddings, the building of a new house and, much
			more frequently, deaths. Elegies were not necessarily sung during the
			funeral itself nor during any feast that took place immediately
			afterwards. In the first place it would take time for the sad news to
			reach the poet’s ears wherever he might happen to be, and then he
			would need time to compose a worthy elegy, and even more time to
			travel to the home of the deceased. Memorial services were held a
			month and a year after the death – the ‘month’s mind’ and the ‘year’s
			mind’ – and it may be that elegies were generally sung on these
			occasions. Apart from these special circumstances, it is unclear
			whether a poet could just drop in on a patron, or whether some homes
			were always open to them – perhaps that is the meaning of the word <span
				style="font-style: italic">rhydd</span> ‘free’ which Guto uses
			several times whilst praising particular houses that provided him
			with patronage (13.1–8). How, too, would a poet know that he would be
			welcome? <span style="font-style: italic">Gwahoddion</span> or
			‘invitations’ are sometimes mentioned, which suggests an expectation
			that a poet would wait to be invited (47.17–20; 55.1–8; 63.1–2).
		</p>
		<p>
			Another interesting question is where a poet would stay overnight
			when he was on a journey to a particular destination. Could he call
			at a patron’s house even though he had no specific poem prepared for
			him? There is reason to suppose that he could, and that he would
			offer other poems in exchange for his food and lodging – perhaps some
			verses of Dafydd ap Gwilym, which certainly seem to have been in
			demand according to one of Guto’s <span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>
			for Henry Griffith of Newcourt (poem 35). If so, then some visits
			could be less formal than others. It is not at all clear how long a
			poet was expected to reside in each house, and indeed this is likely
			to have varied depending on the patron’s resources, generosity or
			patience. It is possible that Guto did not have a home of his own at
			every stage of his career, particularly in the early years, and that,
			instead, he spent all his time travelling from one patron’s house to
			the next. Perhaps Strata Florida abbey, or Raglan, offered him
			shelter for an extended period. In any case, it is likely enough that
			Guto did have a permanent home somewhere. We know that he lived in
			Oswestry at some time in his career.
		</p>
		<p>
			The poetry of Guto and his contemporaries would have been performed
			orally, in front of the patron and in the presence of a wider
			audience. The evidence upon which this statement is based is drawn
			entirely from the poems themselves, although only written copies of
			these are available, and there is therefore a danger of circular
			argument in insisting on the oral nature of the poetry. Even so, the
			references in the poetry to public performance – including the
			particular occasions, the musical accompaniment and the poets’ custom
			of visiting their patrons in order to benefit from their hospitality
			– are so numerous that there is no need for any great concern over
			this question. There is a need, however, to consider the poet’s
			relationship with the written texts. Guto mentions reading books with
			his patrons, particularly Rhys ap Siancyn of Glyn-nedd (poem 15).
			Amongst these was the <span style="font-style: italic">Brut</span>,
			probably one of the Welsh versions of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s
			‘Historia Regum Britanniae’, along with saints’ lives, Triads and <span
				style="font-style: italic">ystorïau</span>, that is, prose tales
			that might be religious as well as secular. Also mentioned is earlier
			poetry – specifically, the works of Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr – which, it
			may well be supposed, would have been old-fashioned and hard to
			understand by Guto’s day, even for an educated poet. And yet, Rhys ap
			Siancyn was the teacher and Guto the pupil, according to the poem at
			least. We may assume that Guto was literate, though there is no
			definite proof of this. It would be interesting to know whether any
			of his patrons asked for written copies of his verses. Only one
			manuscript survives from his own day that contains a collection of
			his poems, namely Peniarth 57, which was probably commissioned by
			Abbot Rhys of Strata Florida. The texts it contains all appear to be
			more or less faultless and they may well derive from recitations or
			texts provided by Guto – indeed, it is not impossible that one of the
			two scribes who copied them was Guto himself (Johnston 2013: 22).
		</p>
		<p class="heading 3">His name</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-style: italic">Guto</span> is a familiar form of
			the name <span style="font-style: italic">Gruffudd</span> (Morgan and
			Morgan 1985: 102–5), though there is no evidence that he was ever
			known by this more standard form of the name. In all likelihood he
			was <span style="font-style: italic">Guto</span> from the beginning,
			though some of his fellow poets refer to him by another, similar pet
			name, <span style="font-style: italic">Gutun</span>, generally when
			they need to for the sake of the <span style="font-style: italic">cynghanedd
			</span>(101a.1n). Some twentieth-century scholars believed that there were
			two different poets called Guto’r Glyn and Guto ap Siancyn, but it
			has now been established that they were one and the same (Salisbury
			2007a). Guto ap Siancyn was the name the poet used at the start of
			his career, but he soon adopted the cognomen of his father, Siancyn y
			Glyn. Siancyn’s first name, like that of his son, is a pet name, in
			this instance derived from <span style="font-style: italic">Ieuan</span>
			(Morgan and Morgan 1985: 137–8). The earliest evidence of Guto’s name
			is in the Peniarth 57 manuscript, which was written before <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440 and is associated with
			Strata Florida. Here, poems are ascribed to <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gutto ap Jankyn</span>. This information
			is confirmed in a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> by
			Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal, perhaps dating from the period <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1437–41 (see below). Ieuan calls
			him <span style="font-style: italic">Y Guto </span>‘the Guto’, <span
				style="font-style: italic">eos y Glyn</span> ‘the nightingale of the
			Glyn’ and <span style="font-style: italic">Guto’r mawl</span> ‘Guto
			of the praise’ and refers to him as <span style="font-style: italic">mab
				Siancyn y Glyn</span> ‘the son of Siancyn y Glyn’ (GHS 24.38, 42, 54, 62).
			There is further support for these forms in two later attributions.
			One of these, <span style="font-style: italic">y gyto ab
				siankyn y glyn,</span> was written in an unknown hand beneath a
			semi-satirical <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to
			Henry Griffith of Newcourt in Herefordshire (poem 35) in manuscript
			Peniarth 55 (<span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1500). The
			other is in LlGC 16964A (<span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1600–50)
			in the hand of Thomas Rees of Carmarthen, ascribing to <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gytto ssiankyn y glyn </span>a <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to request a sallet from
			and on behalf of some north-eastern gentry patrons (poem 73). The
			connections of Peniarth 57, Peniarth 55 and LlGC 16964A with south
			Wales suggest that the early form of Guto’s name was remembered for a
			longer period in some southern regions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Guto’s name was written as <span style="font-style: italic">Gitto
				Glyn</span> on a muster roll for the army of Richard duke of York in late
			May, 1441, probably by an English official in Portsmouth who omitted
			the definite article ([<span style="font-style: italic">y]r</span>)
			and treated <span style="font-style: italic">Glyn</span> as a surname
			according to the English custom (Salisbury 2007a: 1). Three other
			contemporary instances of his name survive. The first two belong to
			the same context, namely two occasions between 1476 and 1478 when
			Guto received payment, along with one <span
				style="font-style: italic">Walter Harper</span>, for his services as
			a minstrel in Shrewsbury (discussed below). As was the case with the
			muster roll of 1441, the definite article is absent since it was, in
			all probability, an Englishman who wrote <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gutto Glyn</span> here. The third example
			is an attribution, in the hand of the poet Hywel Dafi, beneath a <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to request a hunting horn
			from and on behalf of <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span>
			from the north-east (poem 99) in manuscript Peniarth 67 (<span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1483). The form used there is <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gytto or glynn</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was as <span style="font-style: italic">Guto’r Glyn</span>,
			therefore, that he was generally known after <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440, as is apparent from the
			works of five of his fellow poets who referred to him by that name:
			Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf (93.3–4), Hywel Dafi (18a.68), Dafydd ab
			Edmwnd (68a.10), Llywelyn ap Gutun (65a.2) and Gutun Owain (126.6,
			23). As seen in some of the examples mentioned above, the definite
			article was sometimes used when referring to him by his first name
			only; that is, <span style="font-style: italic">y Guto</span> ‘the
			Guto’. This form occurs in the works of Hywel Dafi (18a.9, 59;
			20a.60) and Llywelyn ap Gutun (65a.49, 54) and, indeed, in Guto’s own
			works when he refers to himself (113.31; 114.61). It was mostly pet
			names, such as Guto, Dai or Bedo, that were preceded by the article
			in this manner (TC 3; Morgan and Morgan 1985: 34).
		</p>
		<p class="heading 3">His lineage</p>
		<p>
			The fact that <span style="font-style: italic">Guto</span> used a
			familiar form rather than the standard form of his name, <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gruffudd</span>, is consistent with the
			absence of his lineage from the genealogies. There is a strong
			suggestion that he did not belong to the same rank in society as his
			patrons. Little is known about his lineage save for the name of his
			father, Siancyn y Glyn, and his third cousin, Gruffudd ap Dafydd.
			Gruffudd was one of three younger poets who sought to dislodge Guto
			from Valle Crucis abbey, according to a poem Guto sang in his old
			age, where the blood relationship between the two is described as [<span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>]<span style="font-style: italic">erennydd
				gron</span> ‘a full relation’. Until this Gruffudd can be identified (for a
			discussion, see 116.31–3n), we remain reliant upon other, less
			specific references to his lineage, such as the one in Guto’s poem.
			Guto sang this <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in
			order to chastise Gruffudd and the two others, arguing that he
			himself was the superior poet in spite of the fact that they were <span
				style="font-style: italic">Uwch o waed achau</span> ‘more elevated …
			as regards the blood of their lineage’ (116.49). Since he himself was
			related to one of them, it may be supposed that Guto was not entirely
			lacking in means and family connections and that his forebears
			included <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span> as well as
			humbler folk.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is some further evidence for Guto’s mixed lineage in his short
			bardic debate with Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf (poem 93), where he
			acknowledges that he is of humbler stock than his fellow poet. And
			yet, bearing in mind that Ieuan was a direct descendant of the
			princes of Gwynedd, this says little about Guto’s own status. His
			lineage was not ridiculed by any of the poets who sang satirical <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span> to him and, furthermore,
			he would hardly have been able to obtain a bardic education if his
			family had not been reasonably well off. It may simply be that
			Siancyn y Glyn was a minor <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span>
			whose lineage was not preserved. But the possibility must be
			considered, also, that he was not an <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span>
			but rather a bondman of some kind in the service of an <span
				style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span>, someone who was tied to
			the land but who might, in special circumstances, gain his freedom
			(Carr 1982: 128, 144–50). It is not impossible that Siancyn y Glyn
			did just that, in the wake of the hardship that followed the
			outbreaks of the plague in Wales in the second half of the fourteenth
			century. There was also significant social restructuring following
			the failure of Owain Glyndŵr’s revolt, when many bondmen went about
			purchasing their freedom, taking advantage of the loss of power by
			some <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span> (Davies 1995:
			318–19).
		</p>
		<p>
			Remaining with the subject of Owain Glyndŵr, an interesting
			possibility concerning Guto’s father must be considered. Llawdden
			sang a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to request a
			sword and buckler from Phylib ap Rhys, a son-in-law of Owain, on
			behalf of one Siancyn y Glyn. In this poem Siancyn is referred to as
			a <span style="font-style: italic">brawd o gyfraith</span> ‘brother
			in law’ of the patron and as a [c]<span style="font-style: italic">âr</span>
			‘kinsman, friend’ of his wife, Gwenllïan; she was a daughter of Owain
			Glyndŵr. It is likely, then, that Siancyn was her brother and an
			illegitimate son of Owain, who was often known as Owain y Glyn (GLl
			181). The possibility that Guto was born in Glyndyfrdwy is discussed
			below, though no final conclusion can be drawn. Since we know that he
			was the son of a man named Siancyn y Glyn, it is striking that a man
			of that same name was the son of the most renowned inhabitant of
			Glyndyfrdwy. Even so, bearing in mind the references to Guto’s
			relatively humble lineage noted earlier, it is rather unlikely that
			he really was a grandson of Owain Glyndŵr, the foremost descendant of
			the Welsh princes in his day.
		</p>
		<p class="heading 3">His original home</p>
		<p>
			The location of <span style="font-style: italic">Y Glyn</span> (‘the
			Glen’ or ‘the Valley’) in the name Guto’r Glyn is uncertain. One
			recent suggestion was Llanfihangel Genau’r Glyn, since a man named
			Guto ap Siancyn ap Llawdden was active in the cantref of Penweddig <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1434–46 (Salisbury 2009: 58–60),
			but there is no further evidence to support the idea that Guto came
			from Ceredigion. It is generally believed that his original home was
			Glyn Ceiriog, since this was Ifor Williams’s opinion in his
			introduction to <span style="font-style: italic">Gwaith Guto’r
				Glyn</span> (GGl xxii), but the evidence is not as conclusive as might be
			expected.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ifor Williams relied upon the opening lines of Guto’s <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of the town of
			Oswestry, which mention that he had been a <span
				style="font-style: italic">[b]laeneuwr</span> ‘inhabitant of hill
			country’ in his youth (102.1). Ifor Williams argued that his home
			should be sought in the nearby hills, in line with the fact that Guto
			had sung most of his poems to ‘men of Powys and the March’ and had
			described Syr Rhys, whom Ifor Williams associated with Whittington,
			near Oswestry, as <span style="font-style: italic">f’eglwyswr
				i</span> ‘my priest’ and [<span style="font-style: italic">f</span>]<span
				style="font-style: italic">y nghurad</span> ‘my curate’ (101.13,
			14). It is certainly true that it was in the north-east, particularly
			the region around Llangollen, that Guto sang most of his poems
			according to the evidence of the manuscripts. Even so, this fact
			cannot be relied upon to any great degree since more texts have
			survived from the north-east than from any other part of Wales. It
			was in this corner of the country that substantial amounts of poetry
			were preserved in manuscripts from the sixteenth century onwards,
			giving the impression that the patronage given to poets in other
			regions was scant in comparison. Lewys Glyn Cothi’s poems, on the
			other hand, demonstrate that there was ample patronage available to
			poets in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire but, owing to poor local
			preservation, most of the poems sung in that part of the country were
			lost. Most of Guto’s early poems relate to the South, but that is not
			reason enough to believe that he was a southerner. Furthermore,
			though Syr Rhys may be associated with Whittington, Guto’s references
			to him do not bear any special significance beyond demonstrating that
			the two were living in the Oswestry region when that particular poem
			was sung. There is no certainty, therefore, that Guto was referring
			specifically to the uplands west of Oswestry in the opening of his <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to that town.
		</p>
		<p>Ifor Williams drew attention to one other piece of evidence to
			support his argument in favour of Glyn Ceiriog, namely a reference in
			an article dating from 1879 to Guto’s having been born there, ‘whence
			he derived the appellation … of Guto (or Griffith) of the Glen’
			(Lloyd 1879: 43). No doubt this information, and likewise the similar
			information published in the works of a host of antiquarians from the
			second half of the nineteenth century onwards (cf. Watkin 1920: 66;
			Huws 2011: 57), was drawn from a small book on the history of
			Oswestry published in 1819 under the name of that famous antiquarian
			from the parish of Whitford in Flintshire, Thomas Pennant (Pennant
			1819: 35):</p>
		<p class="cefndir">Gutto or Griffith a native of Glyn Ceiriog, who
			lived in the middle of the fifteenth century …</p>
		<p>
			Guto is mentioned in this book in connection with his <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of Oswestry,
			parts of which are quoted in translation. Pennant died in 1798, so
			the book was brought through the press by Thomas Edwards (who died in
			1871), an Oswestry printer who, according to the book’s title, was
			responsible for providing Pennant’s work with ‘Notes and Considerable
			Additions’ (Watkin 1920: 85, 198). At present it is unclear which of
			the two, Pennant or Edwards, was the author of the information about
			Guto. If it was Pennant, it seems the information should be traced
			back to local tradition that was extant in the early 1770s, when he
			was travelling Wales collecting the material that would later be
			published in his <span style="font-style: italic">Tours of
				Wales</span> (1778–83). Guto is not mentioned, however, in the section of
			that famous work that deals with Oswestry, so it is possible that it
			was Edwards who recorded the information in 1819. Since little is
			known about Edwards, except that he succeeded his father in the
			printing trade and was appointed mayor of Oswestry in 1853 (Cathrall
			1885: 166; Watkins 1920: 187, 198), we can only guess at whether or
			not he drew upon local tradition.
		</p>
		<p>
			It seems that such a local tradition concerning Guto was current in
			the Glyn Ceiriog area in the early decades of the twentieth century,
			when William Rhys Jones (Gwenith Gwyn), a Baptist minister in the
			village between 1912 and 1923, recorded the belief that the poet had
			been born in that part of the parish of Llangollen known as <span
				style="font-style: italic">Traian </span>[sic] <span
				style="font-style: italic">y Glyn</span>, or in local parlance <span
				style="font-style: italic">Y Glyn</span>, that is, the part of the
			parish that lies within the Ceiriog valley (LlGC Papurau Gwenith Gwyn
			I, 330; Huws 2011: 57–8). This connects Guto with a fairly well-known
			region that was close to but separate from Glyn Ceiriog, and it is
			easy to believe that Glyn Ceiriog could have displaced Traean y Glyn
			in relation to Guto because the former was better known outside the
			Ceiriog valley.
		</p>
		<p>In any case, despite the attraction of this possible connection
			with Glyn Ceiriog and Traean y Glyn, only with great caution can it
			be used as evidence for Guto’s birthplace. Bearing in mind how much
			time elapsed between the fifteenth century and the beginning of the
			nineteenth, it is possible that the origin of the information
			recorded by Pennant (or Edwards) and Jones alike was an attempt on
			the part of the inhabitants of the Ceiriog valley to claim the great
			poet for their own region even though the location of his birthplace
			had long been forgotten. Considering all the evidence together, it is
			possible that the belief in a connection between Guto’s early life
			and the Ceiriog valley was based mainly on the fact that this valley
			lies between Oswestry, where Guto set up home as an adult, and Valle
			Crucis abbey, where he spent the final years of his life. This kind
			of consideration can be misleading – it is scarcely likely that
			anyone would claim that Lewys Glyn Cothi came from north Wales on the
			basis of the fact that he settled for a while in Chester (GLGC
			xxvi–xxvii).</p>
		<p>
			Enid Roberts (1977: 14–15) ventured to disagree with Ifor Williams’s
			opinion, arguing that it would be more appropriate to consider
			Glyndyfrdwy as Guto’s place of birth. She refers, without going into
			detail, to readings in manuscript copies of Guto’s <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of reconciliation to Ieuan
			Fychan ab Ieuan of Pengwern which were not used in Ifor Williams’s
			edition and which ‘suggest that Guto was related to Ieuan Fychan’. On
			the basis of this assertion, it is argued that Guto could have been
			related to families with roots in the Dee valley, in spite of the
			fact that Pengwern lies to the south of Llangollen rather closer to
			Glyn Ceiriog than to Glyndyfrdwy. In any case, the new edition of the
			<span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>, which is based on the
			evidence of all the manuscripts (poem 106), does not support the idea
			that Guto and Ieuan Fychan were related. The main basis of Enid
			Roberts’s argument is the assertion that Glyndyfrdwy was the
			best-known <span style="font-style: italic">glyn</span> in the
			period. Glyndyfrdwy, or the shortened form <span
				style="font-style: italic">(Y) Glyn</span>, certainly was used as a
			surname by its fifteenth-century inhabitants. Guto himself refers to
			the most famous of them, Owain Glyndŵr, as <span
				style="font-style: italic">Owain Glyn</span> (52.21–2; 107.46).
			This, however, is not a strong argument in reality because
			Glyndyfrdwy’s fame, by itself, does not provide sufficient grounds to
			associate this location with Guto. He would have had the same name
			had he been born in Glyn Ceiriog or in Traean y Glyn.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two references to the <span style="font-style: italic">glyn</span> in
			Guto’s name are to be found in eighteenth-century manuscripts which
			contain some of his poems. The earliest is likely to be in the hand
			of David Lewis of Coetre, Llanelltyd, and Bronwïon, Brithdir (<span
				style="font-style: italic">fl.</span>1738–d.1766). Sometime between
			1752 and 1758 he added a note next to Guto’s name at the end of his <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> ‘Droving’ (poem 44) in
			manuscript Harvard Welsh e 8 (LlGC 16129D): <span
				style="font-style: italic">Glyndyfrdwy maen debygol Glyn
				ceiriog rwy’n meddwl</span> ‘Glyndyfrdwy probably, Glyn Ceiriog I think’.
			This bears witness to the uncertainty over Guto’s birthplace that
			existed in Meirionnydd by the mid-eighteenth century. As for the
			second reference, on the last pages of the Cwrtmawr 10 manuscript
			(1766) there is an index of poets in the hand of David Ellis of
			Dolgellau (1736–95) which includes the name <span
				style="font-style: italic">Gutto’r Glynn Dyfrdwy</span>. As Ellis
			states on page vi, he wrote the contents of the manuscript when he
			was living in Llanberis, probably before the period he spent as a
			curate in Derwen, north of Corwen, sometime between 1764 and 1788
			(DWB Online). It is not impossible that the reference to Guto derived
			from local knowledge in the Dee valley, though it is more likely, in
			light of the fact that there are at least 80 copies of Guto’s poems
			in Ellis’s hand (three are in Cwrtmawr 10, including poem 118
			addressed to Abbot Dafydd ab Ieuan), that it was a guess based on
			Guto’s association with Valle Crucis.
		</p>
		<p>In reality, all the evidence presented so far concerning Guto’s
			place of origin is much too recent, and in order to shed further
			light on the matter it is necessary to consult evidence that is
			contemporary with the poet himself. As regards Glyn Ceiriog and
			Glyndyfrdwy, it may be highly significant that the one is in Powys
			and the other, it appears, in Gwynedd.</p>
		<p>
			There are two references in fifteenth-century manuscripts to a man
			called <span style="font-style: italic">y gutto o bywys</span> (‘the
			Guto of Powys’) or <span style="font-style: italic">y gutto
				powys</span>. Assuming that both do, indeed, refer to the same man, this
			Guto was i. a poet who sang a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
			in very strict <span style="font-style: italic">cynghanedd</span> to
			request a mail shirt from John Abrahall of Gillow, Herefordshire,
			before <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1443 (poem 120; the
			earliest copy is in Peniarth 53, <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1484);
			ii. a man who wrote his name on a copy of ‘Brut y Brenhinedd’ (<span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1330), apparently at Valle
			Crucis abbey, sometime during the second half of the fifteenth
			century. At first glance, it seems a remarkable coincidence that
			Guto’r Glyn, too, sang in praise of <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span>
			in Herefordshire and the surrounding regions before <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1443 and that he was associated
			with Valle Crucis from <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1465
			onwards, if not before. If the two were in fact the same man, then
			his stamping-ground was Powys and it is likely that Glyn Ceiriog and
			its environs was his home. And yet, it is hard to understand why
			Guto, who was well known as Guto’r Glyn from <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1441 onwards (see above), should
			have called himself <span style="font-style: italic">y gutto
				powys</span> during the second half of the century. It seems much more
			likely that ‘y Guto o Bowys’ was a different poet who adopted his
			second name to avoid confusion with Guto’r Glyn. If so, then
			locations for the <span style="font-style: italic">glyn</span> in
			Guto’s name must be sought outside Powys.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Guto was not a Powys man, then the idea that he was born in Glyn
			Ceiriog or in Traean y Glyn must be set aside and serious
			consideration given to the possibility that he came from Gwynedd. As
			Hywel Dafi states, Guto was not a south Walian but rather <span
				style="font-style: italic">Un o feirdd … / Gwynedd</span> ‘One of
			the poets of Gwynedd’ (20a.39–40). Guto, for his part, refers to
			Hywel as <span style="font-style: italic">un o’r Deheuwyr</span> ‘one
			of the Southerners’ (20.47), and it is known for a fact that Hywel
			was raised in the south-east, perhaps in Raglan. And yet, Hywel’s
			intention in referring to Gwynedd is not entirely clear. He sang his
			<span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in reply to Guto’s
			satire, which ended with the assertion that Guto was an Anglesey man
			(20.77 <span style="font-style: italic">Eled i Fôn, y wlad fau
			</span>‘Let him go to Anglesey, my own country’). It is not impossible that
			Guto had been raised in Anglesey but, as in the case of Llanfihangel
			Genau’r Glyn, there is no other evidence to support this. It is
			unlikely that Guto was referring to the island as the place where he
			was raised. Instead, Anglesey, famous for its patronage, probably
			represented the whole of Gwynedd, and no doubt the island’s position
			in the far north of Wales made it useful as a complete geographical
			opposite to Hywel’s home in Gwent. In a <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of Dafydd ap
			Gwilym of Llwydiarth in Anglesey, Guto calls the island <span
				style="font-style: italic">Fy nhrigfan, fy nhiriogaeth / …
				lle gorau fy maeth, / Fy nghartref, fy nghynefin</span> ‘My dwelling place,
			my territory / … where my best sustenance is, / my home, my habitat’
			and refers to going <span style="font-style: italic">Adref
				unwaith drwy Fenai </span>‘home once across the river Menai’, that is, to
			Anglesey (62.35–7, 42). It is likely that he is pushing bardic
			convention to its extreme here in identifying his own home with that
			of his patron, since Guto maintains in the last line of his poem to
			Dafydd that his ‘soul is in Anglesey’ (<span
				style="font-style: italic">enaid ym Môn</span>, 44). That is, Guto
			envisages the island as his spiritual home (cf. 65.63–6) because the
			generosity of its <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span> is
			proverbial throughout all Wales. For example, Guto praised Hywel ap
			Llywelyn Fychan of Glyn Aeron in Ceredigion, a man with no particular
			connection to Gwynedd, as <span style="font-style: italic">Pennaeth
				byrddau maeth beirdd Môn</span> ‘governor of tables of sustenance for the
			poets of Anglesey’ (10.10; cf. 91.15n). As a result, it is possible
			that Hywel Dafi, too, was maintaining that same conceit in calling
			Guto ‘One of the poets of Gwynedd’ whilst ‘on this side of the river
			Dyfi’ (<span style="font-style: italic">tu yma i Ddyfi</span>,
			20a.45), having in mind Guto’s attachment to Anglesey rather than his
			actual home.
		</p>
		<p>In spite of the ambiguities, it is unlikely that Hywel would
			have called Guto ‘One of the poets of Gwynedd’ if Guto was not
			closely associated with that part of the country. If a well-known
			valley in fifteenth-century Gwynedd is sought, then the most obvious
			candidate by a considerable margin is Glyndyfrdwy, which was part of
			the commote of Edeirnion (Lewis 2013: 173). This argument, in
			reality, is the strongest one for locating Guto’s home, though no
			firm conclusion can be drawn on the basis of the currently available
			evidence.</p>
		<p>
			The only description of the <span style="font-style: italic">glyn</span>
			in Guto’s works provides little guidance. In a poem of thanks
			addressed to Rhisiart Cyffin, dean of Bangor, he calls himself <span
				style="font-style: italic">y mab o’r Glyn maith</span> ‘the man of
			the long Glyn’ (58.42). The ‘long Glyn’ could be an apt enough
			description of any substantial valley, though <span
				style="font-style: italic">maith</span> could also mean that it was
			some way away from the dean’s residence in Arfon. Indeed, the absence
			of any enlightening reference to the <span style="font-style: italic">glyn</span>
			either in Guto’s works or in those of his contemporaries calls into
			question how close Guto’s connection with this valley really was. In
			Lewys Glyn Cothi’s famous elegy for his son he refers to the boy as <span
				style="font-style: italic">Siôn y Glyn</span>, and Lewys himself
			sometimes used a similar form of his own name, <span
				style="font-style: italic">Lewys y Glyn</span>, when recording his
			own poems (GLGC xxii, 237.6). It is not clear whether Siôn y Glyn was
			born in Glyn Cothi, but it may be that in his case <span
				style="font-style: italic">y Glyn</span> was a surname which was
			transferred to the next generation regardless of whether or not that
			generation had its own connection with Glyn Cothi. Could the same
			thing have happened in the case of Guto, son of Siancyn y Glyn, with
			the son’s connection with the Glyn being much weaker than his
			father’s? It is worth remembering that Guto ap Siancyn is the name
			given beneath Guto’s <span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>
			in Peniarth 57, which were written before <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440, and that <span
				style="font-style: italic">Guto[‘r] Glyn</span> is the name in the
			list of soldiers who sailed to France in 1441. No doubt the English
			official who wrote that list in two long columns, one for the first
			names and the other for surnames, asked Guto what was his surname.
			Could it be that Guto came to the conclusion that ‘Glyn’, though he
			had not been accustomed to use this name hitherto, would be a more
			suitable answer for the official’s request than his father’s name,
			Siancyn?
		</p>
		<p class="heading 3">His dates</p>
		<p>
			As discussed below in connection with Guto’s early career, it is
			quite likely that he was active as a poet by <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1431. There is no evidence as to
			when a young poet who had been trained since childhood might start to
			earn his living, but it may be guessed that he would not be much
			younger than fifteen years old. If so, Guto could have been born <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1415, and would have been just
			over twenty when he composed his earliest surviving poems <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1437.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, immediately below the name <span style="font-style: italic">Gitto
				Glyn</span> in the list of soldiers who went to France in 1441 (see below)
			is the name <span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Gitto</span>.
			Johnston (2008: 141) suggested that this Thomas could be the poet’s
			son, and that he travelled to Normandy as his father’s servant. In
			the entire list of soldiers, a document that contains over four
			thousand names, these two men’s names are the only instances of the
			name <span style="font-style: italic">Gitto</span>. It would be a
			remarkable coincidence to find the two recorded together if there
			were not some manner of connection between them. If <span
				style="font-style: italic">Thomas Gitto</span> was a very young lad
			and was indeed acting as his father’s servant (perhaps making arrows
			for him), it is scarcely likely that his name would be recorded as a
			soldier on a list of the army’s companies. Such a record bore witness
			to the fact that each soldier had made a formal undertaking to serve
			the leader of his company for a specific period of time. On that
			basis Thomas cannot have been younger than about sixteen in 1441, and
			would have been born <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1425
			at the latest (for the ages of soldiers in the Middle Ages, see
			Boardman 1998: 73, 75, 182). Assuming for the moment that Guto was
			indeed Thomas’s father, he must have been old enough to have a child
			<span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1425, and so Guto’s own
			date of birth should be pushed back to <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1410 or even <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1405. This would mean that Guto
			was closer to thirty years old when he travelled to France in 1441,
			and had been born during Owain Glyndŵr’s revolt. The work that has
			been done in dating Guto’s poems clearly demonstrates that he worked
			as a professional poet for six decades between <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1430 and <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1490, and so it would be
			difficult to argue with his assertion in one of his last poems that <span
				style="font-style: italic">Hynaf oll heno wyf i</span> ‘Tonight I am
			the very oldest’ (117.2). As discussed below, he sang his last poems
			during the years after 1485, but there is no certainty as to the
			exact date of his death. It can only be suggested that he died <span
				style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1490 at about eighty years of
			age, one of a number of great poets who had long lives and died at
			the close of the century.
		</p>
		<p class="heading 3">His education</p>
		<p>
			Considering the breadth of his knowledge and the brilliance of his
			craft, in his earliest poems as much as in his final ones, Guto must
			have had a thorough bardic education when he was very young. In a
			poem composed when he was an old man at Valle Crucis abbey, he
			proclaims that he has ‘praised the margins of the earth’ (<span
				style="font-style: italic">Moli bûm ymylau byd</span>, 118.9) and
			‘blasphemed’ since he was six years old ([<span
				style="font-style: italic">c]ablu er yn chweblwydd</span>, 118.11) –
			not literally, perhaps, but these lines do seem to suggest that he
			was familiar with the poets’ craft before entering his teens. This is
			reminiscent of Lewys Glyn Cothi’s reference to <span
				style="font-style: italic">fy nghyw yn dysgu fy nghân</span> ‘my
			chick learning my song’ in his heart-rending elegy for his son, Siôn
			y Glyn, who died when he was five years old according to one source
			(GLGC 237.37 and page 633). Furthermore, according to tradition Rhys
			Goch Eryri recognised the poetic talent of Dafydd Nanmor when he was
			a child (Powell 2004: 101–12).
		</p>
		<p>
			Where, and from whom, Guto received his bardic education remains a
			matter for speculation. On the basis of the belief that he was born
			in the Llangollen area (see above), both Strata Marcella (Lewis 1976:
			81–2) and Valle Crucis abbey (Huws 2011: 59) have been suggested as
			possible locations, particularly since more than one Cistercian abbot
			would later provide him with patronage. It is quite likely that there
			was a school at Valle Crucis in the second half of the fifteenth
			century and that it was connected with the Trefor family, Guto’s main
			patrons in the Dee valley (Thomson 1982: 76–7). Two manuscripts which
			attest to the existence of a school in the abbey belong to the period
			<span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1460–80s (LlGC 423D;
			Peniarth 356), when two Welshmen held the office of abbot, Siôn ap
			Rhisiart and Dafydd ab Ieuan. However, it remains an open question
			whether there was a similar school there during the early, turbulent
			years of the century under the patronage of Robert of Lancaster, who
			was abbot 1409–33 (Williams 2001: 298).
		</p>
		<p>
			If Guto ever was educated in an abbey, then he would have received a
			religious education. There is no evidence that monasteries were
			centres of bardic learning, however attractive the idea might be.
			Strata Marcella captured the imagination of Saunders Lewis because
			this was where Guto sang his elegy for Llywelyn ab y Moel in 1440,
			but since Llywelyn is described as <span style="font-style: italic">athro
				gwawd</span> ‘teacher of song’, 82.40) and not unambiguously as [<span
				style="font-style: italic">fy</span>]<span
				style="font-style: italic">athro gwawd</span> (‘my teacher of song’)
			Saunders Lewis did not go so far as to call him Guto’s bardic tutor,
			maintaining simply that he had a strong influence on the young poet.
			This is easy enough to believe, since both Llywelyn and Guto were
			soldier-poets, and such influence can indeed be discerned (Salisbury
			2007b: 151–2). What is likely is that Guto travelled on bardic
			circuit with Llywelyn during the 1430s and, perhaps, the late 1420s.
			The only patron who can be connected closely with Llywelyn, namely
			Sir William ap Thomas of Raglan, also gave patronage to Guto. Rhys
			Goch Eryri’s <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to
			William, in which he requests a golden belt as a gift, prompted
			Llywelyn to sing a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to
			the same patron. Both poems were probably sung in Raglan late in 1433
			or early in 1434 (GRhGE 207; GSCyf 183). It would not be very
			surprising if Guto was present in William’s court when these poems
			were performed, and first travelled to Gwent as a result of his
			association with Llywelyn. Furthermore, Rhys Goch, who took part in
			bardic debates with Llywelyn on more than one occasion and sang an
			elegy for him, was famous for his singing to the family of Penrhyn in
			Gwynedd, another important court that Guto is known to have visited
			in his youth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Little credence can be given to Williams’s suggestion (1997: 201)
			concerning Guto’s education, namely that he received bardic training
			as well as patronage from Dafydd Cyffin of Llangedwyn. This was
			suggested because Guto refers to him as <span
				style="font-style: italic">[y]r Athro Ddafydd</span> ‘Master Dafydd’
			in a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of Sir
			Siôn Mechain, rector of Llandrinio (84.5). But Guto did not choose to
			refer to Dafydd (and to another of his patrons, Sir Benet, rector of
			Corwen) here because they had any role in his early education, but
			simply because Siôn would have been familiar with them as educated
			men in his part of the country. Furthermore, the title <span
				style="font-style: italic">Athro</span> is a reference to Dafydd’s
			own learning rather than to any education Guto might have received
			from him, and it seems that his specialism was the Canon Law and
			Civil Law (from <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1444
			onwards) rather than the learning of the poets.
		</p>
		<p>The most likely conclusion is that the man who introduced
			Guto’r Glyn to poetry was not a monk but rather a poet, or more
			correctly, perhaps, a minor poet who moved in circles that
			occasionally included more important ones such as Llywelyn ab y Moel
			and Rhys Goch Eryri. He could be compared to the tutor who trained
			Llywelyn himself (and, perhaps, Rhys Goch), namely Rhys ap Dafydd, a
			man about whom almost nothing is known and of whose verses only eight
			lines have been preserved (GSCyf 171; GRhGE poem Atodiad 2). In the
			absence of other evidence, all that can be suggested is that Guto’s
			father, Siancyn y Glyn, may have had some involvement with his son’s
			first steps in the poetic art. Saunders Lewis (1976: 81) conjured up
			a scene in which some educated man noticed Guto’s ‘exceptional
			promise’ when he was very young and provided him with an education,
			but it is scarcely likely that an ordinary youth would have had the
			opportunity to display any promise unless his family already had some
			kind of connection with poetry.</p>
		<p class="heading 3">His appearance</p>
		<p>Saunders Lewis (1976: 81) painted a rather attractive picture
			of Guto as ‘an exceptional boy … [who] quickly grew to become a tall
			youth, well-built, swarthy, strong-featured, with an axe of a nose,
			black hair – he became bald before middle age – hands like a smith’s
			– was his father a smith? – a champion at stone-throwing and
			horsemanship’ (our translation). No doubt some of these details are
			the product of Saunders’s lively imagination, but the general
			likeness is supported by the works of Guto and his contemporaries.</p>
		<p>Both Syr Rhys and Llywelyn ap Gutun sang satirical poems to
			Guto, one in the 1460s and the other in the 1480s. In both cases the
			satire hinges upon the fact that Guto had been a strong man in his
			youth but now, in his old age, was much weaker (65a.29; 101a.31–6).
			This information is supported by Guto’s own reference to the renown
			he won by throwing a heavy stone (33.43–4), a feat that Gutun Owain,
			likewise, mentions in his elegy for Guto (126.16). It is also worth
			noting that it was as an archer that Guto enlisted in the army of
			Richard, duke of York, in 1441. A number of references to archery in
			his poems suggest that he was very familiar with this skill (poem 11;
			31.33–62), and no doubt his strength and, perhaps, his height would
			have been a great asset (cf. Hardy 1994: 179; for a fuller discussion
			of Guto as an archer and a soldier, see Day 2013).</p>
		<p>
			The satirical portrayal of a frail and elderly Guto in the poems of
			Syr Rhys and Llywelyn must be modified somewhat, since both admit
			that he was, notwithstanding, still a man of considerable size. Both
			refer to him as a <span style="font-style: italic">cyff</span> ‘log’,
			and no doubt Guto’s size contributed to the comic effect of
			Llywelyn’s description of different parts of his body as the dwelling
			places of a host of sea creatures (65a.7–32; 101a.55). It is also
			necessary to modify some of Dafydd ab Edmwnd’s descriptions of Guto
			in a satirical <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> which
			claims that the poet suffered an injury as a result of lifting
			weights when he was young. Though it is unclear whether Guto really
			did rupture himself, it seems that his size made him an easy target
			for a poet who, according to Guto’s own satire, was much smaller in
			stature. Dafydd maintains that Guto was [<span
				style="font-style: italic">b</span>]<span style="font-style: italic">oliog</span>
			‘big-bellied’ (68a.11), and there are references in other poems to
			his fondness for his food (cf. Salisbury 2011: 101–2). It is likely,
			however, that it is to the rupture that Dafydd is referring. Bearing
			in mind that Guto lived for a very long time and travelled widely
			throughout his life, he is unlikely to have been fat; rather, he may
			have had a naturally large frame. Indeed, Syr Rhys describes him as
			an <span style="font-style: italic">annair gul</span> ‘lean heifer’
			during his alleged illness in Oswestry (101a.26).
		</p>
		<p>
			Llywelyn ap Gutun refers to his fellow poet’s [<span
				style="font-style: italic">b</span>]<span style="font-style: italic">wyall
				drwyn</span> ‘axe-shaped nose’ and <span style="font-style: italic">wyneb
				arth</span> ‘bear’s face’ (65a.14, 20), and Guto himself supplies a
			memorable description of his large head and face in a <span
				style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of Abbot Thomas
			of Shrewsbury: <span style="font-style: italic">Mae i mi wyneb
				padrïarch / A chorun mwy no charn march</span> ‘I have the face of a
			patriarch / and a crown larger than a horse’s hoof’ (77.59–60). His
			meaning, it seems, is that, when he sang to the abbot, he had a large
			face showing signs of age, and was losing his hair. In another poem,
			dating from the last decade of his life, he states that he has a <span
				style="font-style: italic">trawswch</span> ‘moustache’ and a [<span
				style="font-style: italic">b]arf</span> ‘beard’ (109.40, 55), though
			it seems clear that he lost the rest of his hair when he was quite
			young. Hywel Dafi calls him <span style="font-style: italic">moel
				brydydd</span> ‘the bald poet’ in a satirical poem which probably dates
			from the first half of the fifteenth century (18a.64). Guto’s own
			counsel to his fellow burgesses in Oswestry is that his payment for
			his burgess-ship should be postponed <span style="font-style: italic">nes
				ym dyfu gwallt</span> ‘until I’ve grown hair’ (102.47–50) – that is,
			indefinitely! This poem may date from the 1460s. Some two decades
			later, in the 1480s, he described himself as an <span
				style="font-style: italic">eidion moel</span> ‘bald bullock’ in
			Wiliam ap Gruffudd’s court at Cochwillan (55.31–2).
		</p>
		<p>
			Guto did have hair at one time, though, and it is likely to have been
			black. Having praised the black hair of Henry Griffith, Guto appears
			to include himself amongst the other splendid things that are black
			in colour, along with Jesus’s hair, velvet and ebony (33.1–10). In a
			<span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> addressed to another
			swarthy or black-haired patron, Guto maintains that this is <span
				style="font-style: italic">gorau lliw dyn</span> ‘the best colour a
			man can have’. Furthermore, Dafydd ab Edmwnd satirizes him by
			referring to his <span style="font-style: italic">ceilliau
				duon</span> ‘black testicles’ (17.13; 68a.65).
		</p>
		<p>
			One other fact that is worth mentioning is that Guto lost his sight
			at the end of his life. All but one of his references to his
			blindness date from his years at Valle Crucis (114.62; 116.45–8;
			117.14, 49–50; 119.3), when he also had difficulty hearing (119.4),
			but a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of thanks for a
			horse addressed to Dafydd ap Meurig Fychan and Elen daughter of Hywel
			of Nannau indicates that he continued to travel on the bardic circuit
			for a while, even when his sight was failing. Guto compares himself
			to another man who lost his sight but who refused to yield to his
			disability, namely Fulk Fitzwarine, and maintains that he has a real
			need for the horse in order that he might emulate his hero and, as
			before, defeat [<span style="font-style: italic">m]il o’r glêr
				fân</span> ‘thousands of the petty poets’ (51.41–52).

				<p>
					Although Guto’s exact year of birth is unknown, it is quite likely
					that he entered the world either during or soon after Owain
					Glyndŵr’s revolt. The fiercest fighting ended in 1406 but the
					conflict continued until <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1417.
					By that year, Owain was in his grave and the lands of many rebels
					had been forfeited and transferred to new landowners. But there
					were a number of former rebels among those landowners, men who kept
					hold of their forfeited lands and re-established themselves, often
					in improved circumstances, in the new society. These <span
						style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span>, and their sons in
					particular, would sustain Guto’s muse.
				</p>
				<p>
					One former rebel who led the way in taking possession of forfeited
					lands was Gwilym ap Gruffudd of Penrhyn, the most powerful <span
						style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span> in north Wales at the
					start of the century. Although no poem to Gwilym by Guto survives,
					he is the earliest patron for whom we have evidence that Guto
					praised him. In a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					addressed to Gwilym’s son, Wiliam Fychan, Guto states quite clearly
					that he had received patronage from his father (56.19–20n):
				</p>
				<p class="cefndir">Adeilais glod i Wilym,<br/>
				Adail ei fab awdl fu ym.</p>
				<p class="cefndir">
					<span style="font-style: italic">I built a praise poem for
						Gwilym, / my ode was his son’s construction.</span>
				</p>
				<p>Gwilym died early in 1431 (Carr 1990: 17). If Guto sang an
					elegy for him in that year (as did Rhys Goch Eryri and Gwilym ap
					Sefnyn, GRhGE poem 2; Bowen 2002: 74), it is noteworthy that there
					is a gap of some years between that and his earliest surviving
					poems. It is not impossible either that he sang in praise of Gwilym
					whilst the latter was still alive.</p>
				<p>
					This early reference to now-lost praise was a stumbling block for
					Roberts (1977: 14) when it came to identifying Guto’r Glyn and Guto
					ap Siancyn as one and the same poet, since she maintained that
					Guto’r Glyn began his bardic career around 1455/60. But now that
					the two have been proven to be the same person it is, in reality,
					no great surprise that Guto should have been singing as early as <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1430. A very mature poetic
					craft is apparent already in his earliest surviving poems, showing
					that he must have honed his skills during his early travels on
					bardic circuit, about which little is now known. If Guto was raised
					in the Llangollen area it would have been natural enough for him to
					visit Gwynedd on his earliest circuits outside his native land,
					before venturing to the South some years later. Indeed, perhaps the
					connections by marriage between the family of Penrhyn and the
					Trefor family in the Dee valley proved helpful to his career. It
					may be concluded that the poetry he composed for patrons in north
					and south Wales <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1430–5
					has been lost, perhaps because he had yet to gain recognition as a
					poet.

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">1.2 </span><span class="head">A
						soldier-poet in Normandy</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					The earliest surviving poems that can be dated with any certainty
					were sung in late 1437 or early 1438, and their subject is a Welsh
					<span style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span> who had been in
					France since at least 1424. Indeed, it may be their peculiarity in
					this regard that ensured their survival. Both are <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span> in praise of Sir
					Richard Gethin of Builth, a professional soldier who won renown
					fighting for the Crown in Normandy (poems 1 and 2). As a son of
					Rhys Gethin, a man who had fought on the side of Owain Glyndŵr at
					the start of the century, warfare was a way of life for Richard,
					and he is named as captain of Mantes from 1432 onwards. These were
					the final decades of what is now known as the Hundred Years’ War
					between England and France, a long and costly struggle for the land
					and crown of France that ended in 1453, when the English were
					finally driven out of Normandy and Gascony. As discussed below, it
					is known for certain that Guto served Richard duke of York in 1441
					as part of the duke’s second military expedition in France. But it
					is likely that he also took part in the duke’s first expedition, as
					a member of the army that landed at Honfleur on 7 June 1436
					(Johnson 1988: 29). Unfortunately, the list of soldiers who
					mustered at Honfleur does not appear to have survived. The fact
					that Richard Gethin’s name is absent from the records from the end
					of 1438 onwards strongly suggests that he died around the end of
					that year or soon afterwards. It is quite likely that Guto went to
					Normandy in 1436/7 and met his patron there. The duke travelled to
					Rouen, his headquarters in France, but no further details can be
					ascertained concerning Guto’s own movements. It is possible that he
					travelled to Mantes, of which Richard was captain, but it is also
					possible that the duke had summoned Richard to Rouen and that it
					was there that the poet met his patron. The duke returned to
					England around 8 November 1437 (ibid. 30), but Guto may have come
					home considerably earlier, having completed his official period of
					service as a soldier, generally six months. This would mean that he
					left France either in late 1436 or early 1437, and it is quite
					likely that he sang both poems in praise of Richard soon after
					returning to Wales (not in France, as claimed by Saunders Lewis
					1976: 86–90).
				</p>
				<p>
					At about the same time Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal sang a noteworthy <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> on Guto’s behalf to thank
					Richard for a golden cloak he had given to Guto, probably in
					exchange for his praise poetry (GHS poem 24). The strong suggestion
					is that Ieuan intended to convey Guto’s appreciation from Wales to
					France and present it to Richard in person. Though there is no
					evidence that Ieuan served as a soldier in Normandy, the name of
					his father, Hywel Swrdwal, is recorded as a soldier in the service
					of Richard duke of York in Rouen in 1445 and 1447 (Soldier LME s.n.
					<span style="font-style: italic">Howell Sourdoual</span>, <span
						style="font-style: italic">Houel Sourdonel</span>). Assuming that
					the poem of thanks addressed to Richard is correctly attributed in
					the manuscripts to Ieuan (as opposed to his father Hywel), it is
					likely that Ieuan also travelled to France, or intended to do so at
					some point.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guto returned to Normandy in late June 1441. His name is recorded
					as <span style="font-style: italic">Gitto Glyn</span> in a list of
					soldiers who mustered at Portsmouth in late May (Salisbury 2007a:
					1; Johnson 1988: 35). He was an archer in the personal company of
					the duke of York. The duke was leader of a much more substantial
					army on his second expedition in Normandy, and it is likely that
					Guto’s own experiences would have been rather different from what
					they had been in 1436. It is reasonable to suppose that he
					travelled with the duke straight to Pontoise in order to recapture
					the town from the possession of Charles VII. The army met with John
					Talbot and his own army in Juziers on 13/14 July and they captured
					Pontoise without opposition some days later (Pollard 1983: 55–6).
					Having reinforced the town, they went in pursuit of Charles,
					crossing the river Oise in Beaumont before Charles retreated to
					Poissy, south of the river Seine. On 24 July the armies of the duke
					and Talbot were on Charles’s trail once more, re-crossing the Oise
					in Heuville. But the duke’s army came into conflict with French
					forces, suffering heavy losses, and it is likely that the duke led
					his army to Rouen soon after and that Talbot led his own forces on
					to Poissy in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Charles. The duke
					reached Rouen on 1 August, ‘his troops haggard, starving and
					exhausted’ (ibid. 57). Over a month later, Charles recaptured the
					town of Pontoise. If Guto took part in these events, he could take
					pride only in his contribution to keeping in check the French gains
					in Normandy. It is likely that he spent a period of six months in
					France before returning to Wales either in late 1441 or early 1442.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two other poems bear witness to Guto’s campaigns in France. The
					first is his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in
					praise of Matthew Gough, another Welsh soldier who fought overseas
					from 1423 until 1450, a few years short of the end of the war (poem
					3). As in the case of the poems that Guto sang to Richard Gethin,
					the likelihood is that the poem to Matthew was performed in Wales,
					and it is unclear whether Guto ever actually met his patron. It is
					not known where Matthew Gough was in 1436/7 during Guto’s probable
					first visit to Normandy, though it might be expected that he would
					have been a fairly regular visitor to Rouen, the capital of the
					region. Between 1439 and 1442 he was captain of Bayeux, a city to
					the west of Caen and some distance away from the region between
					Pontoise and Rouen where Guto was stationed in 1441. But he took
					part in the task of besieging and capturing Harfleur in October
					1440, and it is not impossible that he was still in the town when
					the duke’s army landed there, perhaps, in June 1441. But even if
					Guto never saw the famous soldier, he would certainly have heard
					enough about him from Richard Gethin, who fought with him against
					Joan of Arc at Beaugency in 1429.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second poem relating to France is one of Guto’s most remarkable
					<span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>, namely his praise
					of Thomas ap Watkin of Llanddewi Rhydderch in Gwent (poem 4). Here
					Guto foreshadows a military campaign in France by staging a mock
					battle between Thomas, his poets and his reciters on the one hand
					and some French wines, representing the famous French leaders, on
					the other. It is a lively evocation of the excitement and
					enthusiasm of a group of men preparing to go to war. Guto may have
					sung it before he travelled to France in 1436. However, since there
					is no certainty that Thomas took part in that campaign, it is much
					safer to assume that the poem dates from the spring or early summer
					of 1441, because the name <span style="font-style: italic">Thomas
						Watkyns</span> appears as an archer (along with his brother, <span
						style="font-style: italic">Johan Watkyns</span>, as a mounted
					man-at-arms) in the list of soldiers who sailed from Portsmouth in
					June that year (Salisbury 2007a: 44n115; Soldier LME s.n.).
				</p>
				<p>
					The names of two of Guto’s other patrons appear in that list of
					soldiers in the duke of York’s army in 1441. The most noteworthy is
					Sir William ap Thomas of Raglan (Salisbury 2007a: 39n52; Soldier
					LME s.n. <span style="font-style: italic">William ap Thomas</span>),
					an <span style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span> of considerable
					authority who rose swiftly in the duke’s service during the 1430s
					and was a member of his council in 1441. Guto sang a notable <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of praise to William in
					which he calls him <span style="font-style: italic">iustus
						doeth</span> ‘wise judge’ (19.18), a reference to the office of deputy
					justiciar of the southern principality which he held from 1439
					until his death in 1445. As mentioned above, it is possible that
					Guto had visited Raglan as early as 1433 in the company of Llywelyn
					ab y Moel and Rhys Goch Eryri, and it is not surprising to see him
					receiving patronage from William some years later. It is possible,
					too, that Guto was the author of an elegy sung for William in 1445,
					of which only a fragment survives in the manuscripts (poem 125).
					Furthermore, with the exception of Richard Gethin’s home in Builth
					and Matthew Goch’s in Maelor, Guto could scarcely have chosen a
					better place than Raglan in which to perform the poems that he sang
					to these two soldiers in their absence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The list of soldiers also contains the name of <span
						style="font-style: italic">Henry Griffith Eskuier</span>, an <span
						style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span> from the parish of
					Bacton, Herefordshire, whom the Welsh called Harri Gruffudd
					(Salisbury 2007a: 39n51; Soldier LME s.n.). No doubt Guto and Henry
					were fairly close contemporaries, and the very fact that Guto
					became a soldier had much to do with Henry’s great familiarity with
					military matters. Henry was a member of the garrison of Carentan in
					northern Normandy in 1431 under the authority of Sir Nicholas
					Burdet of Warwickshire (Chapman 2013: 108). Though Guto’s poems to
					Richard Gethin are the earliest than can be dated with any
					certainty, there are others that might well have been sung before
					1436. One of these is a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					in praise of Henry (poem 32). The poem was recorded in Peniarth 57
					sometime before <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440
					(RepWM; Salisbury 2007a: 11–12), though only a fragment has
					survived. It is a great pity that the rest has been lost, for its
					contents could very easily have cast more light upon this exciting
					period in Guto’s early life. As it is, we must rely on what Guto
					says in his elegy for Henry (36.23–5):

						man to the top of the harp-string.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					As can be seen, it was at Henry’s urging, in all likelihood, that
					Guto entered the duke’s service as a soldier, sometime between <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1433, when Henry returned to
					Wales from Carentan (Chapman 2013: 109), and 1436. There is an
					unusual sense of closeness in Guto’s poems to Henry which reflects
					a friendship beyond the usual relationship between poet and patron.
					Guto sang a notable <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					in praise of Henry’s black hair – possibly because Guto’s own hair
					was dark – in which he refers to the great prowess they both had in
					throwing a heavy stone (poem 33). Henry, of course, is supreme, as
					he is, too, in another interesting <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					that Guto sang promoting Henry’s cause in his competition with the
					poet Ieuan Gethin for the love of Gwladus of Glyn-nedd (poem 34).
					It appears that Gwladus, who may have been a daughter of one of
					Guto’s patrons, Rhys ap Siancyn of Glyn-nedd, was a bardic pupil of
					Ieuan’s, but Guto’s advice to her is not to have anything to do
					with that old man, but rather to go to the court of young Henry,
					where she will be well satisfied. Gwladus is mentioned again in
					another <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> that Guto
					sang to Henry, this time in order to chastise his patron for
					refusing to pay his poets (poem 35). Henry provides wine in plenty
					but it is hard to get money out of him, an accusation that would
					surely have vexed him and which reflects the nature of his
					relationship with Guto. Guto is scarcely likely to have felt
					comfortable enough in the company of other patrons to be able to
					voice a similar complaint about miserliness. It is clear that Guto
					knew Henry well enough to feel that he could say whatever he liked
					in his poems to him, which were in all likelihood sung during the
					1440s and 1450s.
				</p>
				<p>
					One other poem must be mentioned in connection with Guto’s military
					career, namely his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd </span>in
					praise of John Talbot, second earl of Shrewsbury (poem 78).
					Assuming that Guto had seen his patron’s father, the soldier John
					Talbot who was made first earl of Shrewsbury in 1442, on campaign
					with the duke of York in Pontoise and the surrounding area in 1441,
					it is tempting to suggest that he came into contact with the second
					earl through his military connections. The internal evidence of the
					poem suggests that it was sung between <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1437 and early 1445. It is
					perhaps no coincidence that Guto would, in years to come, also sing
					in praise of the duke of York’s son (poem 29).

					<span class="headingNumber">1.3 </span><span class="head">A
						bardic circuit in the South?</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					As well as what remains of a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					in praise of Henry Griffith, Peniarth 57 contains a handful of
					other poems by Guto, all sung before <span
						style="font-style: italic">c.</span>1440. One other poem can be
					connected with Henry, namely a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					in praise of his uncle, Phylib ap Gwilym Llwyd of Tregunter in the
					Wye valley (poem 30). Phylib may have been a tenant of Henry’s but
					Guto does not refer to the relationship between uncle and nephew,
					instead mentioning another of his patrons – indeed, his main patron
					in his youth – Abbot Rhys ap Dafydd of Strata Florida. It appears
					that Guto had sworn an oath to Phylib that he would visit him
					instead of the abbot, but broke his word because the patronage he
					received in the abbey was so generous. Subsequently the abbot gave
					Guto leave to visit Phylib. The restrictions placed by the abbot
					upon his poet’s movements should probably not be interpreted too
					literally, but the strong suggestion is that Guto was engaged in a
					bardic circuit that encompassed parts of Ceredigion, the south-east
					and the Valleys. It is likely that this circuit included Newcourt,
					Henry’s home in Herefordshire, and the homes of at least two other
					patrons who are the subject of poems in Peniarth 57, namely Sir
					William, priest of Merthyr Tydfil, and Rhys ap Siancyn of
					Glyn-nedd. Both poems are noteworthy: the one, the earliest poem
					that can be connected with Merthyr, for its masterly portrayal of a
					priest’s love for the (female) patron saint of his parish (poem
					16); and the other for the glimpse it provides of a patron reading
					and discussing literary gems with his poet (poem 15).
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not impossible that Raglan and, perhaps, Thomas ap Watkin’s
					home in Llanddewi Rhydderch were part of the same bardic circuit,
					along with Siancyn Havard’s home in Brecon. In his <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of Siancyn
					(poem 31), Guto compares his patron to a bow of good yew wood which
					aims golden arrows at his poets, a strong echo of the fact that it
					was as an archer that Guto was recruited into the duke of York’s
					army. But since this poem was not preserved in Peniarth 57, as far
					as is known, it is perhaps safer to suppose that Guto sang it
					during a later visit to Brecon, perhaps in the 1440s and around the
					same time that he sang his biting semi-satirical <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to Henry Griffith (poem
					35), discussed above. The same general complaint is voiced in the <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to Siancyn, where <span
						style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span> who are reluctant to
					provide patronage are compared to fragile, broken bows and reviled
					for turning their backs on their Welsh roots (31.29–32):
				</p>
				<p class="cefndir">Yr hwn a fu’n rhoi ennyd,<br/>
				Efô fydd gybydd i gyd,<br/>
				Ac eraill gynt a gerais<br/>
				A brŷn swydd a breiniau Sais.</p>
				<p class="cefndir">
					<span style="font-style: italic">He who used to be
						open-handed for a while, / now he’s an undiluted miser, / and
						others whom once I used to love, / now purchase the position and
						rights of an Englishman.</span>
				</p>
				<p>The two poems are an important record of the difficulties the
					poets had to face on occasion, and their attitude is reflected in
					brief references in other poems by Guto throughout his career. The
					impression created by the majority of the poems that have come down
					to us is that the nation abounded in red-blooded patrons who kept
					their doors forever open to every wandering poet who happened to
					drop by. Some of Guto’s poems indicate that the reality of the
					situation could be somewhat different from the poetic ideal, with
					some patrons being obliged to put the interests of their careers
					before their good name as patrons. They also testify to Guto’s own
					readiness to express his discontent where necessary.</p>
				<p>
					Another poem that demonstrates Guto’s awareness of the archer’s
					skill is his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in
					praise of Rhys ap Dafydd of Uwch Aeron in Ceredigion (poem 11). As
					in his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> for Siancyn
					Havard, the archery is metaphorical, but here the patron is the
					target of the poet, whose praise is the arrows. This extended
					metaphor is maintained from the first line to the last. The poem is
					preserved in Peniarth 57, along with a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in praise of another
					patron from the vicinity of the river Aeron, Hywel ap Llywelyn
					Fychan of Glyn Aeron (poem 10). This time the metaphor turns on
					Hywel’s grip upon the poets’ praise, envisaged as a divine ball
					that came into his possession after having been passed down the
					generations since the time of the ‘Three Generous Ones’. The fact
					that the two poems are preserved in Peniarth 57 proves that they
					were sung before <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440
					(and indeed, Rhys died in 1439/40), and it is also possible that
					they were part of the same bardic circuit as some of the
					above-mentioned poems sung in the south-east. Considering them all
					together, they could be the fruit of a bardic journey that
					traversed the uplands from Strata Florida to the valleys of the
					Black Mountains in the Marches, before turning towards Merthyr
					Tydfil and then the upper Neath valley. From there the journey back
					to the abbey would have led the poet through Carmarthenshire and
					Ceredigion, and it would be no surprise if the hearths of Rhys and
					Hywel enticed him to within sight of the sea. If such was the case,
					then it is interesting to note that the journey from the Valleys to
					the Aeron may have passed by Llanybydder and the home of another <span
						style="font-style: italic">uchelwr</span> who provided Guto with
					patronage, namely Dafydd ap Tomas of Blaen-tren. However, as in the
					case of the poem in praise of Siancyn Havard and the semi-satirical
					poem addressed to Henry Griffith, the fact that the poems Guto sang
					to Dafydd are absent from Peniarth 57 suggests that they date from
					a later period. Indeed, in his masterly ode in praise of Dafydd,
					Guto refers to his <span style="font-style: italic">taith
						faith</span> ‘long journey’ to his patron’s court <span
						style="font-style: italic">o Fôn i oror Aeron / … drwy
						Fabwynion</span> ‘from Anglesey to the banks of the river Aeron / …
					through Mebwynion’ (12.47–8), and he came <span
						style="font-style: italic">trwy Deifi</span> ‘through the river
					Teifi’ in order to sing a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					of praise to him (13.4). Furthermore, Guto says that he spent <span
						style="font-style: italic">pedair blynedd</span> ‘four years’ (15)
					in the March before returning to Blaen-tren, a strong suggestion
					that this bardic circuit in Carmarthenshire dated to after <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440, perhaps during the 1440s
					or 1450s. Dafydd is praised for his talent as a love poet, amongst
					other things (12.37–42), an early reference in Guto’s works to a
					patron who practised the craft of poetry as well as patronizing it.

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">1.4 </span><span class="head">Glamorgan

				<p>
					Guto received patronage from at least two other patrons in the
					south-east during the 1440s or 1450s, but there is no reason to
					believe that their courts were part of the bardic circuit outlined
					above. The earliest patron to whom Guto is known to have sung in
					this region is David Mathew, a man from Llandaf and the subject of
					a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> which also praises
					his four sons and his wife, Gwenllïan, who was a cousin of Sir
					William ap Thomas. David’s effigy may be seen to this day in
					Llandaf cathedral.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second is Morgan ap Roger of Gwynllŵg near Newport, the patron
					of two remarkable <span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>
					by Guto and Hywel Dafi. Hywel composed the first of them, in which
					he accuses Guto (perhaps with tongue in cheek) of flattering his
					patrons in his praise poems (poem 18a). Hywel himself does not want
					to be guilty of this fault and tries to praise Morgan without
					yielding to the temptation to exaggerate. Guto’s honest answer is
					that he does, indeed, sometimes use flattery in his verses, but
					that this is not incompatible with the nature of the poets’ craft
					(poem 18). His praise is full of exaggeration because that is the
					kind of poem that his patron and his audience want to hear.
					Moreover, that kind of praise is much more attractive than what
					Hywel offers, and Guto proves this by praising Morgan in his own
					inimitable style. The two poems form an interesting and
					sophisticated discussion of the poets’ main actvity of eulogy, and
					they were to be be followed by at least one further light-hearted
					debate between the two poets in Raglan castle in years to come.
				</p>
				<p>Another patron whom Guto may well have praised in this period
					is Trahaearn ab Ieuan of Pen-rhos. As is discussed below, Guto
					composed a request poem for Trahaearn during the 1480s in which he
					seems to be on quite familiar terms with his patron. Other earlier
					poems for Trahaearn may have been lost.</p>

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">1.5 </span><span class="head">Abbot
						Rhys ap Dafydd</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					However many homes Guto visited during his early bardic circuits in
					the South, it is certain that he returned time after time to Strata
					Florida abbey. Peniarth 57 preserves three<span
						style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span> to the man who
					‘prevented’ him from travelling to the court of Phylib ap Gwilym
					Llwyd in Tregunter, Abbot Rhys ap Dafydd. Rhys deserves special
					attention because, as far as is known, he was Guto’s main patron in
					his youth. It was probably Rhys who commissioned the production of
					Peniarth 57 in Strata Florida, and it is not impossible that he was
					one of the manuscript’s two main scribes (Salisbury 2007a: 18–19).
					If this small manuscript had never been commissioned, or if it had
					been lost, then our knowledge of Guto’s early career would be much
					the poorer. Guto sang two other poems to Rhys that do not occur in
					Peniarth 57, namely an ode of praise and an elegy. In the case of
					most patrons, only one, or at most two, poems addressed to them
					have survived, and, though rich enough in some respects, the poems
					often convey only one aspect of the relationship between poet and
					patron. The three <span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>
					to Rhys in Peniarth 57 provide a fuller picture of that
					relationship, since they contain not merely unmixed praise but also
					concern and uncertainty over the abbot’s troubles and his frequent
					absences from the abbey.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to one <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					Rhys was suffering from some sickness or physical injury that
					compelled him to leave Strata Florida (unless he was already away
					from home when he was taken ill), and Guto maintains that he will
					overcome this affliction just as he overcame the enemies who sought
					to oust him from his abbacy (poem 5; Salisbury 2009: 65–9). In
					another <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>, Guto
					expresses his discontent that Rhys has left the abbey to visit
					Oxford, perhaps on the occasion of the establishment of the
					Cistercian college of St Bernard there in 1437/8 (poem 6; Salisbury
					2009: 69–74). It is likely that these two poems were sung during a
					visit to the abbey between Guto’s first sojourn as a soldier in
					France in 1436 and his second in 1441. There is less certainty in
					the case of the third <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					to Rhys, which portrays a conversation concerning the abbot between
					the poet and his tongue (poem 7; Salisbury 2007b: 149–55; 2009:
					74–7). At just 44 lines, this is a short <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in comparison with every
					other poem from the period before <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1450,
					and clearly shows the influence of Llywelyn ab y Moel, who also
					composed a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> based on
					the idea of holding a conversation with his tongue (Salisbury
					2007b: 151–2; GSCyf poem 12). This, along with the poem’s simple
					structure, strongly suggests that it is the earliest of Guto’s
					surviving works. Bearing in mind that he was active as a poet as
					early as <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1431, it is not
					impossible that the poem was sung between 1429/30, when Rhys was
					appointed abbot of Strata Florida, and 1436.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guto’s poems to Rhys, and his ode in particular (poem 8) bear
					witness to the abbot’s cultural and architectural activity in
					Strata Florida. Rhys tried his best to restore the abbey to good
					condition and prosperity after a period of extensive destruction
					during Owain Glyndŵr’s revolt, but his ambition proved greater than
					his means, and as a result of his debts he was imprisoned in
					Carmarthen in 1439/40. He died in prison around the end of 1440 or
					the beginning of 1441, and Guto sang a magnificent elegy for him
					(poem 9). This poem is amongst Guto’s longest <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span> and is an emotive
					tribute to a patron who was, perhaps, of very much the same age as
					him. But there is also a suggestion in the poem that Guto’s
					attention in the summer months of 1441 was wandering and that he
					had already committed himself to serve the duke of York, hundreds
					of miles away from the troubled abbey in Ceredigion (9.13–20).

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">1.6 </span><span class="head">On
						circuit in the North</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					All the poems discussed so far were sung to <span
						style="font-style: italic">uchelwyr</span> in south Wales. The
					only possible exception is the poem to Matthew Gough of Maelor, but
					there is no telling where exactly this poem was performed
					considering that its subject was campaigning in France at the time.
					It is known that Guto sang in Penrhyn, near Bangor, <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1431, but there is a gap of
					almost a decade before we have a surviving poem from north Wales
					that can be dated with certainty. In February 1440, about a year
					before he sang his impressive elegy for Abbot Rhys in Strata
					Florida, Guto sang an elegy for Llywelyn ab y Moel in Strata
					Marcella (poem 82). As already noted above, it is very likely that
					Llywelyn had some considerable involvement in Guto’s early career
					as a professional poet, though he does not appear to have been his
					bardic tutor. Rhys Goch Eryri also sang an elegy for Llywelyn,
					which is the latest of his poems that can be dated with any
					certainty (GRhGE poem 10). The performance of these two poems was a
					turning point in the development of the style of the <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>: one, by the ageing Rhys,
					is rich in <span style="font-style: italic">sangiadau</span>
					(phrases inserted into a line without a syntactical link to the
					main sentence), whilst the other, by the young Guto, moves
					regularly from one neat couplet to the next.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are only two other poems from Guto’s early career for which a
					fairly certain estimate of their date can be given. The first is a
					praise <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> for the four
					sons of Edward ap Dafydd of Bryncunallt in the lordship of Chirk, a
					relative of Owain Glyndŵr who fought on his side in the revolt
					(poem 103). Though the sons’ qualities are the poem’s main subject
					matter, several lines praise Edward and it is clear that he was
					alive when it was performed. Edward died on 25 April 1445, and Guto
					sang an elegy for him (poem 104). Though no more precise date can
					be offered for the praise poem to Edward’s sons, bearing in mind
					the fact that Guto was in Strata Marcella abbey at the time of
					Llywelyn ab y Moel’s death in 1440, it is not impossible that it
					dates from the same period. These poems are the earliest ones that
					can be connected with the north-east.
				</p>
				<p>The next poem for which a definite date can be suggested
					belongs to a slightly later period in Guto’s career, namely his
					elegy for Robert Trefor (discussed below), but it is likely that
					there are some other surviving poems that date from early on. One
					poem was sung in Shrewsbury, a clear indication of the wide
					geographical range of bardic circuits in Guto’s day (poem 77). Its
					patron was Abbot Thomas of the town’s Benedictine abbey, and Guto
					playfully asserts that he himself wishes to become a cleric so that
					he might spend all his time in the abbot’s company.</p>
				<p>
					Guto sang three rather remarkable praise <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span> to Hywel ab Ieuan
					Fychan of Moeliwrch near Llansilin, a man whose name is mentioned
					in records between 1408/9 and 1416/17. His father, Ieuan Fychan ab
					Ieuan Gethin, was present in Glyndyfrdwy in September 1400 when
					Owain Glyndŵr was proclaimed Prince of Wales. Owain’s famous court
					at Sycharth stood not far away from Ieuan’s home in Moeliwrch, and
					both were burned to ashes by English forces in May 1403 (Huws 2007:
					106–7). Guto sung one of his poems to Hywel to celebrate the
					rebuilding of Moeliwrch (poem 90). This was an event of some
					importance that also drew other poets to the lime-washed house on
					the high slope above Llansilin, men such as Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf
					and, perhaps, Syr Rhys. Indeed, it is possible that Moeliwrch was
					the scene of the exchange of <span style="font-style: italic">englynion</span>
					between Ieuan and Guto, in which the former says he does not wish
					to share his bed with the latter because he is <span
						style="font-style: italic">un o’r glêr </span>‘one of the
					minstrels’ (poem 93). Guto replies by reminding Ieuan that his own
					lineage is not entirely unmixed. As in the case of the other two <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span> that Guto sang to
					Hywel, no precise date can be offered for the poem in praise of
					Moeliwrch, but Hywel’s known dates, along with the poem’s metrical
					craft, suggest an early date, perhaps <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1440. In another <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> addressed to Hywel, Guto
					refers to an <span style="font-style: italic">abad draw</span>
					‘abbot yonder’ with whom he had made <span
						style="font-style: italic">amodau</span> ‘provisos’ that he would
					not leave him (91.59–62). There is nothing in the poem to suggest
					which abbot is meant, but the lines do call to mind Guto’s mention,
					in his praise poem to Phylib ap Gwilym Llwyd of Tregunter, that he
					had sworn an oath to Abbot Rhys of Strata Florida that he would not
					visit other patrons. If it is indeed Rhys that he had in mind, then
					Guto’s poems to Hywel may be counted amongst his earliest.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to Hywel that
					contains the reference to the abbot is amongst Guto’s most
					remarkable works (poem 91). About halfway through he states that
					other poets are disgruntled because he sings so little to other
					patrons, an accusation that stems, it is asserted, from jealousy of
					the close relationship between him and Hywel. Guto’s response is to
					portray that relationship as a marriage, though not an earthly
					marriage between <span style="font-style: italic">gwas a
						gwen</span> ‘a young man and woman’. Rather, this is a divine union
					ordained by God. The <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					provides a refined and unique portrayal of the interdependent
					relationship between poet and patron, as, too, does another poem
					that Guto sang to Hywel when the patron injured his knee (poem 92).
					Guto makes full use of a topos common in sympathy poems, according
					to which the poet himself is portrayed as suffering grievously when
					his patron is ill. But Guto is no ordinary poet, and he offers to
					heal Hywel through the power of his poetry, just as the legendary
					Taliesin succeeded in freeing his own patron, Elffin, from prison
					by means of his poetic gift. Guto then calls upon the aid of a
					multitude of saints in order to heal the injury and ensure that
					Hywel will be fit and able to provide patronage once more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mali daughter of Iolyn, one of Hywel’s cousins, was the wife of one
					of Guto’s patrons in the commote of Deuddwr, namely Gruffudd Fychan
					ap Gruffudd Deuddwr of Collfryn. The sole surviving copy of a
					praise poem addressed to Gruffudd is ascribed to Guto. This
					ferocious <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					commemorating the patron’s feats in fighting against an Englishman
					who had come to ravage his land (poem 83) most probably refers to
					some now-forgotten conflict during or directly following Owain
					Glyndŵr’s revolt. The style of the poem, with its use of <span
						style="font-style: italic">sangiadau</span>, is quite different
					from most of the other poems that Guto sang in his youth, but it
					may be significant that the poet himself does not remember the
					incident, and had therefore, perhaps, been born after the fighting
					took place (83.49–58). If Guto was indeed the author, he may well
					be reminding Gruffudd and his audience of his patron’s courage
					years before, and the poem could be one of his very earliest works.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only other poem to have survived from the period of Guto’s
					youth is from the north-west, namely a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> to request an Irish
					mantle from Elen daughter of Robert Puleston of Llannerch, Llŷn
					(poem 53). Indeed, this is the only poem from the north-west that
					can be connected with Guto’s early career. In this case the early
					date rests on its metrical craft and the fact that Elen was a niece
					of Owain Glyndŵr. It is the earliest of Guto’s request poems, a
					genre he would employ extensively in his later career. This early
					request for an Irish mantle demonstrates Guto’s inventive ability
					to describe a gift imaginatively, as well as his fondness for
					demonstrating that he was a poet who had an eye for the latest
					fashions.

				<p>Only one of Guto’s poems can be dated with certainty to the
					1450s (poem 105). It is an elegy for one of the duke of York’s
					officers in the lordship of Denbigh, Robert Trefor of Bryncunallt,
					eldest son of the Edward ap Dafydd who had previously been a patron
					of the poet. This splendid elegy for Robert, composed in 1452,
					refers to his four sons as four towers resembling the famous towers
					of Caernarfon castle. One of those sons was Siôn Trefor, known to
					have later been a patron of Guto’s, though none of the poems
					composed for him has survived.</p>
				<p>
					Other poems with a Marcher location may belong to the 1450s, such
					as the two <span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>
					performed at the home of Sir John Burgh and his wife Joan at
					Wattlesborough in Shropshire. These can only be dated sometime in
					the years 1439–71. They raise an interesting issue, in that it is
					very uncertain that either of the recipients understood Welsh; they
					were, after all, English, as far as we can tell. Did Guto himself
					communicate with them in English? It is hard not to think so. But
					if so, why would the couple patronize verse they could not
					understand? The answer may be that the example set by the
					landowning class in Wales proper exercised an influence over the
					mixed society of the Marches. The poems Guto composed for this
					couple are a praise poem for Sir John (poem 80) and another for his
					wife (poem 81). In the latter he warmly thanks Joan and her
					daughter Isbel for looking after him as he lay sick in their house.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problematic poem, composed sometime during the period
					1448–1476/7, is the <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					asking for reconciliation with Ieuan Fychan ab Ieuan of Pengwern
					near Llangollen (poem 106). The bone of contention between poet and
					patron is not known, but the light-hearted tone makes it difficult
					to see any association with the imprisonment of Ieuan Fychan’s sons
					in 1457, an association suggested in some manuscripts and upheld by
					some modern scholars.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moving now to the north-eastern March, and Maelor Gymraeg in
					particular, we find Guto composing an elegy for Siôn ap Madog
					Puleston of Hafod-y-wern near Wrexham, sometime after 1461 (poem
					72). Since this area was apparently on Guto’s itinerary
					mid-century, it may well be possible to assign one of the most
					striking of his request poems to this period. This is a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> asking for a sallet from
					Wiliam Rodn of Holt on behalf of Dafydd Bromffild of Bersham (poem
					73). The poem describes a full suit of armour, but it is bereft of
					the steel helmet needed for completeness. Then the sallet is
					metaphorically conjured up, being compared with a lamp, the housing
					of a bishop (i.e. a mitre), a loaf made of steel and, in the final
					lines, a bright sun that will rise in the east and set in the west
					– the direction of travel from Holt to Bersham. Was it also in this
					same period that Guto went to Chester? His intent was to appeal to
					the famous Rood there in the church of St John the Baptist to cure
					an injury that one of his patrons had suffered. Certainly his <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> for Dafydd ab Ieuan,
					whose leg had been hurt by an arrow, contains a promise to make
					such a pilgrimage (poem 92), but unfortunately nothing more is
					known of the patron.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guto’s striking poems for Hywel ab Ieuan Fychan of Moeliwrch, which
					belong to an early stage in his career, have already been
					mentioned. The poet continued to work for other members of Hywel’s
					extended family in the eastern valleys of the Berwyns during the
					1450s and 1460s. Hywel’s cousin, Dafydd Cyffin ab Iolyn, settled
					near Llangedwyn in the Tanad valley, where Guto praised him
					sometime between 1444 and 1462 (poem 94). Following the Tanad
					downstream we reach the home of another of Guto’s patrons in these
					years, namely Abertanad, which stood on the border between the
					lordships of Powys and Oswestry. The householder was a brother of
					Hywel of Moeliwrch, Gruffudd ab Ieuan Fychan. It was a sad event
					that provoked the first surviving <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					for the Abertanad family: the death of Gruffudd’s wife, Gweurful
					daughter of Madog, was the occasion for poem 88. It evokes
					melancholy images of the empty house and the quiet grave in
					Llanyblodwel church. In this border region a monoglot Welshman
					might be made a figure of fun by some of his neighbours, as appears
					to have happened to the son of Gruffudd and Gweurful, Dafydd Llwyd
					ap Gruffudd. A praise poem sung by Guto to Dafydd (poem 86)
					contains a stirring defence of Dafydd’s loyalty to his mother
					tongue, as well as praise for more commonly noticed virtues such as
					his strength and his generous treatment of guests. It, together
					with the elegy for Dafydd’s mother, suggests that Guto was a fairly
					frequent visitor to Abertanad over an extended period. On another
					occasion Guto thanked Dafydd’s wife, Catrin daughter of Maredudd,
					for giving him a new purse (poem 87). Dafydd and Catrin both died
					in 1465. Guto’s elegy in honour of Dafydd (poem 89) is a powerfully
					emotional one. It refers to the bubo (Welsh <span
						style="font-style: italic">cornwyd</span>) that appeared on his
					body three days before he died, revealing that he was suffering
					from the plague. His wife Catrin was already dead by then, in all
					likelihood from the same disease.

				<p>
					Dafydd Llwyd of Abertanad was a relative of Sieffrai Cyffin of
					Oswestry, one of Guto’s most important north-eastern patrons.
					Although it is difficult to date any of the poems to Sieffrai with
					confidence, it is certain that Guto was already singing for him
					before the death of Dafydd Llwyd in 1465. He composed a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> requesting a brigandine
					from Sieffrai on Dafydd’s behalf (poem 98), in which he says that
					Sieffrai held office in Oswestry. He calls it [<span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>]<span
						style="font-style: italic">apteniaeth</span> or ‘captaincy’.
					Sieffrai is known to have been one of the bailiffs of the town in
					1463. If that is the office referred to, then the poem may date to
					the early 1460s, but a date in the previous decade is also
					possible. That is true also of the <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					of praise which names Sieffrai’s wife, Siân (poem 97). If we accept
					the testimony of the sixteenth-century antiquarian Gruffudd
					Hiraethog, then Sieffrai married his second wife, Ann, in 1467, and
					that gives a <span style="font-style: italic">terminus ante
						quem</span> for poem 97. On the other hand, it is likely that two other
					poems composed for Sieffrai, a praise poem (poem 96) and a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> requesting two greyhounds
					from Robert ab Ieuan Fychan of Coetmor (poem 100), are later in
					date. It is very likely too that a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					asking for a hunting horn on behalf of Siôn Eutun (poem 99) was
					composed <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1475, while
					Sieffrai was seneschal of the lordship of Chirk. A notable feature
					of Guto’s praise for Sieffrai is the attention he pays to
					Sieffrai’s travels, especially in the poem addressed to him and his
					wife together (poem 97), where Guto notes that he went on
					pilgrimage to Rome and even further afield, to the Holy Land. Guto
					suggests that Sieffrai’s father Morus had been a noted traveller
					too – he went to Prussia and to Arras.
				</p>
				<p>
					The poems for Sieffrai Cyffin are closely connected with one of
					Guto’s most remarkable works, his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					of praise for the town of Oswestry (poem 102). It contains generous
					compliments for the town, of which Guto tells us that he was a
					burgess. A document of sixteenth-century date confirms that Guto
					did indeed win this status through praising the town in verse. The
					poet tells us that he had once, in his youth, been a <span
						style="font-style: italic">[b]laeneuwr</span> – that is, someone
					who lived in the uplands – but now, an old man, he chooses the
					comforts of town life. The poem may belong to the 1460s, and
					Sieffrai’s holding of the constableship in Oswestry may have had
					some influence on the decision to award Guto the status of a
					burgess in exchange for poetry. However, it is not clear when
					precisely Guto settled in the town, nor whether he had lived there
					for some time before becoming a burgess. Though Guto does not name
					any of his fellow burgesses in the <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					to Oswestry, it is very likely that both Sieffrai and his nephew,
					Maredudd ap Hywel, were among them. A powerful praise poem for
					Maredudd probably belongs to this period (poem 95). This is more
					certainly true in the case of the debate poems that Guto exchanged
					with the priest-poet Syr Rhys, for Guto mentions him in a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of praise for Sieffrai
					(97.25–8). According to Syr Rhys, illness had prevented Guto from
					travelling to Valle Crucis abbey, and Syr Rhys goes on to mock the
					wretched food that Guto had to eat at home in comparison with the
					splendid feast that was waiting for him at the abbey (poem 101a).
					Guto responds by accusing Syr Rhys of accepting an invitation to a
					meal with him at his home, and then behaving crudely and
					ungraciously while drunk (poem 101). Though the poem does not say
					that the house in question was in Oswestry, the bread on Guto’s
					table is called <span style="font-style: italic">bwrdeisiaidd</span>
					‘burgess-like’, which is very suggestive. These debate poems also
					contain the only information about Guto as a married man. His wife
					was called Dwgws, a pet-form of <span style="font-style: italic">Dyddgu</span>.
					We do not know how long they were married. Syr Rhys’s comment that
					Guto had become enfeebled in old age compared with the strong man
					he had once been, and that this was disagreeable to Dwgws, suggests
					that they had been together since Guto’s youth, but there is no
					unambiguous statement of this. The abbot of Valle Crucis at the
					time was Siôn ap Rhisiart, who was in office from <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1455 until 1480; alas, no
					verse in his honour has survived under Guto’s name. Nevertheless,
					it is clear that the poet was a frequent visitor there during the
					1460s.

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">2.3 </span><span class="head">On
						circuit in mid- and west Wales</span>
				</h4>
				<p>Around mid-century, it appears that Guto spent most of his
					time in the east of Wales and the Marches. In fact, only one poem
					for a patron outside those areas can definitely be attributed to
					this time. Barely a month after the coronation of Edward IV in July
					1461 there was an altercation at court between an unnamed
					Englishman and Siôn Dafi, a Welshman from Melverley in Shropshire
					who had settled in London. Siôn was punished by the public severing
					of his hand in the market at Cheapside, one Friday in August of
					that year. A vituperative poem by Guto commemorates the occasion
					(poem 41). It was apparently performed in Cemais, near Machynlleth,
					and in Siôn’s absence, since the latter was in London. What
					connection Siôn Dafi had with Cemais is unknown, but a poet local
					to that area, Dafydd Llwyd of Mathafarn, composed a satire on him
					sometime during the reign of Edward IV, accusing Siôn Dafi of
					having blackened his name before the king. We can be sure that Siôn
					was a familiar figure in the area.</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, there are numerous poems for patrons in mid- and
					north-west Wales which, though they cannot be accurately dated,
					should in all probability be assigned to the years 1450–70. For
					instance, there is a <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					of praise for Dafydd Llwyd ap Dafydd of Newtown, composed before
					the patron’s death, sometime between 1465 and 1469 (poem 37). In it
					the poet laments, not entirely seriously, that he cannot find any
					fresh material about Dafydd, since so many other poets have sung
					his praises, among them Gwilym ab Ieuan Du, Llawdden and one of the
					Swrdwals. Not far north of Newtown was the home of another patron,
					Maredudd ab Ifan Fychan of Cedewain. Guto composed a poem asking
					him for a horse on behalf of a Welshpool relative of Maredudd’s,
					Rheinallt ap Rhys Gruffudd (poem 39). If we follow the Severn
					eastwards we reach Vaynor (Y Faenor), the home of Edward ap Hywel
					and Gwenllïan daughter of Rhys, a short distance south-west of the
					village of Berriew. It is possible that Vaynor was damaged during
					the Glyndŵr rebellion; at any rate, a new building was erected by
					Edward and Gwenllïan on the ‘hill above Berriew’, and was
					celebrated by Guto in poem 38. The house is compared to Owain
					Glyndŵr’s former residence at Sycharth, ‘once raised upon the
					slopes of a mound’. It is a good example of the rebuilding that was
					so prevalent in fifteenth-century Wales.
				</p>
				<p>
					A note in the hand of Thomas Evans (written between 1604 and 1624)
					informs us of the location where Guto and other poets composed a
					series of <span style="font-style: italic">englynion</span>
					satirizing Tudur Penllyn. The occasion was the marriage feast of
					one Dafydd ap Maredudd Fychan, the place apparently south of
					Newtown and near Llananno. This is the earliest certain example of
					the custom known as <span style="font-style: italic">cyff
						clêr</span>, in which a senior poet would be made a figure of fun by
					others, drawing on a semi-fictional storyline. The victim would
					then be allowed to respond. The conceit on this occasion was that a
					wolf had stolen Tudur’s testicles; his own son, Ieuan, was among
					the mockers. Indeed, out of the poems attacking Tudur only those of
					Ieuan and Guto have survived (poems 46a and 46), though in his
					response Tudur names eight others who took part, including Gutun
					Owain (poem 46b). The date is not known for certain, but all the
					poets involved flourished between the 1450s and 1470s.
				</p>
				<p>It is probable that Guto visited Nannau, a well-known centre
					for patronage near Dolgellau, sometime during the 1460s to praise
					Meurig Fychan ap Hywel Selau, his wife, Angharad daughter of
					Dafydd, their son, Dafydd, and Dafydd’s wife, Elen daughter of
					Hywel (poem 49). Guto devotes a section to each individual in turn,
					the praise being fairly unexceptional until he reaches Elen
					(49.37–48). Elen, a granddaughter of Gweurful daughter of Madog,
					had once looked after the poet, and others, while they were sick.
					This happened in Bala, not far from her family home in Rug near
					Corwen. Guto promises to visit Nannau again if he reaches old age,
					a promise which he appears to have kept. There is a strong
					reminiscence here of a poem of praise by the fourteenth-century
					poet Llywelyn Goch ap Meurig Hen, in which Llywelyn promises to
					live with his patrons at Nannau in his old age. The patrons in
					question were Meurig Llwyd, the grandfather of Guto’s patron, and
					his brother, Hywel (GLlG poem 8).</p>
				<p>
					If Guto ever visited the home of Elen’s family at Rug, there is
					alas no surviving poetry for them. But we do know that he spent a
					good deal of time in Edeirnion in the 1450s or 1460s, particularly
					in the company of Sir Benet, rector of Corwen. Sir Benet is named
					as the holder of that position in 1439, so it may be that some at
					least of Guto’s verse for him dates back into the 1440s or even the
					1430s. Poem 43 is an ode of praise for Sir Benet. Much more
					unusual, however, is the <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					known as ‘<span style="font-style: italic">Porthmona</span>’ or
					‘Droving’ (poem 44). It recounts the adventures that Guto underwent
					while taking lambs belonging to Sir Benet to be sold in the markets
					of central England. Even though he had the help of two servants,
					Guto’s attempt at droving was not a success, according to the poem.
					He lost many of the lambs to accidents, and no-one would offer him
					a fair price for the rest. He went as far as Coventry and
					considered going on to York, but in the end he settled for
					Lichfield and Stafford, before making his way back to Edeirnion.
					And, although Sir Benet was willing to employ him again, he swears
					that he will never again turn his hand to such a business. The
					journey was surely not entirely fictional, for Guto notes in
					passing in a poem for Sir Siôn Mechain (poem 84) that he had often
					undertaken droving for Sir Benet. ‘Droving’ evoked a humorous
					response by Tudur Penllyn (poem 44a), and the two poets went
					head-to-head (poem 45). There is also an elegy extant by Guto for
					Sir Benet, who died in 1464 (poem 47).
				</p>
				<p>A short distance south of Corwen, in the hills above the
					river Dee between Cynwyd and Llandrillo, stood another of the
					houses where Guto found a welcome in Edeirnion, that of Ieuan ab
					Einion of Cryniarth. Guto praised his patron and his wife, Angharad
					daughter of Dafydd, together with their eight children, giving
					particular attention to Dafydd ab Ieuan, who had already fought in
					France and would, later on, hold Harlech castle against the
					Herberts, Guto’s powerful patrons in south-east Wales (poem 48). In
					the neighbouring region of Penllyn was another centre of patronage,
					Llechwedd Ystrad in the hills above Llangywer beside Llyn Tegid.
					Here was the home of Einion ap Gruffudd, a man whose death Guto
					lamented in an emotional poem in which he describes Einion as a
					renowned poet as well as a generous patron (poem 42). He also tells
					us that Einion was buried on the far side of the Berwyns in the
					church of Pennant Melangell.</p>
				<p>
					Caernarfonshire is another area where Guto is likely to have worked
					in the 1450s and 1460s, though barely any of his poems for patrons
					in this region can be dated with confidence to this time. Mention
					has already been made of Guto’s visits as a very young poet to
					Penrhyn near Bangor, where he praised Gwilym ap Gruffudd. He
					returned to praise Gwilym’s son, Wiliam Fychan, perhaps between
					1457 and 1463. The manuscripts offer us two poems of praise for
					Wiliam, one containing a reference to archery (not unlike the poems
					for Rhys ap Dafydd and Siancyn Havard) and the other extolling
					Wiliam’s influence in various regions of Gwynedd (poems 56 and 57).
					It also mentions that Wiliam controlled the ferry at Porthaethwy
					which carried travellers between Anglesey and the mainland. Guto
					would have used this ferry to visit patrons in Anglesey at around
					the same time as he worked for Wiliam. One family in particular
					stands out, the descendants of Llywelyn ap Hwlcyn of Prysaeddfed. A
					poem of praise for one of Llywelyn’s grandsons, Dafydd ap Gwilym of
					Llwydiarth, in which Guto calls Anglesey the abode of his soul,
					dates after 1450/1 (poem 62). Guto certainly received plenty of
					patronage on the island; another of his poems addresses five sons
					of Llywelyn ap Hwlcyn, perhaps in the 1460s (poem 63). Each brother
					receives two couplets of praise, beginning with the eldest and
					ending with the youngest; the poet then calls to mind Iolo Goch’s <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> for the four sons of
					Tudur Fychan of Anglesey (GIG poem V). Then each brother is praised
					again with a further two couplets, likening each in turn to a
					different precious stone: Meurig is the philosophers’ stone, Huw
					Lewys a diamond, Dafydd a ruby, Gruffudd an almandine and Rhys a
					sapphire. The poem is similar to ones composed by Guto for the four
					sons of Edward ap Dafydd of Bryncunallt and the eight children of
					Ieuan ab Einion of Cryniarth, but of all these works the poem for
					the five Anglesey men is the most exquisitely crafted.

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">2.4 </span><span class="head">Dafydd
						ab Edmwnd</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Guto engaged in poetic debates with several of his colleagues –
					Hywel Dafi, Tudur Penllyn, Syr Rhys and Llywelyn ap Gutun – yet his
					relationship with one of the most influential poets of the
					fifteenth-century retains an element of mystery. There are
					attributed to Guto some three <span style="font-style: italic">cywyddau</span>
					satirizing Dafydd ab Edmwnd of Pwll Gwepra in Northop (poems 66, 67
					and 68). Dafydd was a poet who came to prominence by winning the
					silver chair at an <span style="font-style: italic">eisteddfod</span>
					held in Carmarthen around 1451 under the patronage of Gruffudd ap
					Nicolas. In his turn he would be the bardic teacher of Gutun Owain
					and Tudur Aled.
				</p>
				<p>
					One at least of the satires appears to have been incited by a boast
					made by Dafydd, perhaps during his attempts to reform the poetic
					craft (<span style="font-style: italic">cerdd dafod</span>) at the
					Carmarthen <span style="font-style: italic">eisteddfod</span>
					(66.6, 26). It names five poets who will hunt Dafydd like a pack of
					hounds. The authorship of the poem is dubious, however, for Guto
					himself appears to be one of the poets addressed by the author. Not
					named in this poem is Gwilym ab Ieuan Hen, yet his satire against
					Dafydd ab Edmwnd may relate to the same controversy, since it too
					refers to Dafydd’s boasting in connection with other poets
					(including, perhaps, Guto, see GDID poem XXIII). It is also
					reminiscent of another <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					by Guto (poem 67). This one is a more superficial satire on Dafydd
					ab Edmwnd’s wretched appearance. Dafydd is portrayed as a soldier
					who, for all his bravery in war, bears decidedly unheroic marks of
					battle. He is described as ‘Syr Rhys’s dwarf’ as regards prophetic
					poetry (67.46), words that are echoed by Gwilym ab Ieuan Hen in a
					similar context, but the significance is obscure. Somewhat clearer
					is the context of another satirical <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> by Guto, for it is a
					response to a poem by Dafydd ab Edmwnd that has survived (poem
					68a). The allegation, true or false, was that Guto had ruptured
					himself while weightlifting, a sport that Guto describes as a
					specialism of his in another poem (33.39–46; cf. also 126.16).
					There is an <span style="font-style: italic">englyn</span> by
					Dafydd on the same subject (poem 68b). Both Dafydd’s satire and
					Guto’s response (poem 68) are thoroughly scatological. The latter
					focuses on Dafydd’s outsize and diseased penis. None of these poems
					can be located or dated, but references by Guto to Syr Rhys and a
					mention of Guto’s wife by Dafydd ab Edmwnd make the 1450s or 1460s
					likely.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since there is no authoritative edition of the works of Dafydd ab
					Edmwnd, nor any detailed study of his attempts to reform <span
						style="font-style: italic">cerdd dafod</span> at the Carmarthen <span
						style="font-style: italic">eisteddfod</span>, we can only
					speculate as to why Guto satirized him more than any other poet.
					They were certainly very different characters, one a physically
					powerful ex-soldier who composed poetry for a living, the other of
					short stature and in no need of patronage to sustain himself. If
					Guto disapproved of Dafydd’s actions at the <span
						style="font-style: italic">eisteddfod</span> – and it is worth
					noting that Guto, in spite of having a career of some two decades
					behind him by 1451, is not known to have attended the event – there
					is no suggestion in his poems to that effect; Llawdden, in
					contrast, expressed his views in some satirical stanzas (GLl poems
					34, 36). At present it is not possible to say whether the
					increasingly rigorous metrical standards of Guto’s later work
					reflect the Carmarthen reforms or developed independently of them.

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">2.5 </span><span class="head">William
						Herbert and his family</span>
				</h4>
				<p>Undoubtedly Guto’s most prominent patron was William Herbert
					of Raglan. He was the son of Sir William ap Thomas, and he
					inherited Raglan castle following the death of his father in 1445.
					It is uncertain when Guto first caught his attention, but in all
					likelihood the poet’s services were amongst the other things passed
					down to Herbert from his father. Guto was a frequent visitor to
					Raglan and witnessed Herbert’s extraordinary rise from local squire
					to major player in English politics during the series of
					confrontations known as the Wars of the Roses.</p>
				<p>The years 1449–53 were troubled ones for the English kingdom.
					In 1449 the French launched a devastating campaign against the
					English-held towns in Normandy. The English could not withstand the
					power of Charles VII, and in less than a year they lost every last
					inch of Normandy. At the battle of Formigny in 1450, the complete
					defeat of the English sealed Normandy’s fate. Among the captains
					captured on the field was the young William Herbert. He was freed
					on the payment of a large ransom and managed to return to Wales
					safe and sound. Matthew Gough, on the other hand, was less
					fortunate, being killed in London in 1450 during the revolt of Jack
					Cade. Then in 1453 came another blow: the conquest of Gascony by
					the French. It had been an English foothold on the Continent since
					the twelfth century. Only the town of Calais now remained of all
					the possessions of the English Crown in France.</p>
				<p>Following the disasters in France the 1450s were a difficult
					decade. Cade’s revolt broke out in Kent, and though it was quickly
					extinguished, tensions rose between Richard, duke of York, and the
					supporters of King Henry VI. Many of Guto’s patrons, being tenants
					and followers of the duke, were bound to be drawn into this
					quarrel. Meanwhile, Guto continued to practise his profession. He
					should not be thought of as a ‘Yorkist’ poet during the 1450s, nor
					for that matter should his patrons who supported the duke be so
					termed. The dispute between the duke and Henry VI’s extended family
					was over respect and influence around the person of the king, not a
					struggle for the Crown itself. Not until the end of 1460 did
					Richard, duke of York, claim the throne, and even as late as this
					there are signs that many of his followers were unwilling to go so
					far as to unseat an anointed king. The vast majority of the
					landowning class in both Wales and England wished only for a fair
					settlement between the two sides. We may well imagine that a
					professional poet who depended on a varied network of patrons
					across Wales would be particularly eager to see such quarrels
					amongst them put aside.</p>
				<p>By the 1450s William Herbert was one of the duke of York’s
					chief supporters. Guto would have been a frequent visitor to Raglan
					during this decade, but any poems he composed directly for Herbert
					during this time have perished. There remains, however, the debate
					poem which attacks Hywel Dafi for spending too much time sponging
					on Herbert’s hospitality at Raglan (poem 20). It is the first of
					Guto’s extant poems under William Herbert’s patronage and may be
					dated to before the end of 1453, since it refers to Herbert’s
					mother Gwladus Gam as still alive (though it should be noted that
					her death date of 1453 is not beyond doubt). A degree of
					circumspection towards Herbert is, perhaps, the most noteworthy
					feature of this poem, in spite of the leg-pulling directed at the
					luckless Hywel (who composed a reply, poem 20a). Even at this early
					stage, Herbert was not a man to be crossed.</p>
				<p>The son of Richard, duke of York, was crowned king as Edward
					IV in 1461. The new king’s grip on Wales was fragile at best. Only
					the south-east was at all secure under the authority of the earl of
					Warwick and William Herbert, who were cooperating happily enough at
					this stage. Further west or north than that the authority of Edward
					IV barely made itself felt. It was these anxious months following
					the battle of Towton (end of March 1461) that saw the beginning of
					the process by which William Herbert was elevated above any other
					individual in Wales. He was appointed justiciar, chamberlain,
					steward and chief forester of Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire,
					with his brother Richard as deputy. Moreover he and his
					brother-in-law, Walter Devereux, were commissioned to recover the
					earldom of Pembroke and its appurtenances. After that Herbert was
					given control of the lands of the Buckingham family in Wales, among
					them the lordships of Brecon and Newport. Then the new men headed
					west. Jasper Tudor, Henry VI’s half-brother, fled northwards to
					escape them, leaving his castle of Pembroke to fall into Herbert’s
					hands. Inside Herbert discovered the four-year-old Henry Tudor, son
					of Jasper’s brother. Herbert took him home with him to Raglan,
					where Henry was raised until 1469. In the meantime, Jasper Tudor
					had been defeated at the battle of Twthill near Caernarfon, and was
					forced to flee to Ireland.</p>
				<p>
					As a consequence Herbert now dominated south-west Wales. The only
					place to reject his authority was Carreg Cennen castle, held by
					Tomas and Owain, sons of Gruffudd ap Nicolas. Herbert had to lead a
					second campaign, in 1462, to take the stronghold from them. We do
					not know whether Guto was an eyewitness of Herbert’s campaigns, but
					he would later refer to them in glowing terms in the <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> he composed for Herbert
					at the zenith of his power in 1468 (poem 21).
				</p>
				<p>The year 1468 was an important one in Guto’s career. It was
					then, at last, that Edward IV decided to deal decisively with the
					rebels in Gwynedd and granted Herbert the authority and resources
					he needed in order to bring the region to heel. Indeed, Adam
					Chapman (unpublished paper delivered at the Guto’r Glyn Conference,
					Aberystwyth, 2012) has shown that the sum expended on the 1468
					campaign was comparable to the cost of one of the yearly
					expeditions to Normandy earlier in the century – an enormous sum of
					money to spend on the capture of one castle, however strong. The
					suspicion must be that Harlech was no more than the icing on the
					cake, and that the authority of Edward IV was barely recognized
					anywhere in the three shires of North Wales. That would explain why
					Herbert and his fellow-captains had to bring a huge army and
					devastate much of Gwynedd before its inhabitants would submit.
					Harlech castle surrendered to him on 14 August, and Guto
					congratulated Herbert in a most powerful poem (poem 21). He also
					begged Herbert to show mercy to the gentry of Gwynedd, among them
					many of Guto’s own patrons. It would be intriguing to know when,
					and in front of whom, this poem was performed, as well as the
					degree to which its contents were acceptable to Herbert, and
					whether any others were involved in commissioning it as a mark of
					their submission to the conqueror from the south. All we can
					actually be certain of is that it was composed before 8 September,
					when Herbert was made earl of Pembroke. It is inconceivable that
					such an honour would not have been mentioned had it already been
					bestowed.</p>
				<p>One possible beneficiary of Guto’s appeal to William Herbert
					was Sir Roger Puleston of Emral, if the editor of poem 74 is
					correct in believing that it was composed by Guto between March
					1469, when Roger was pardoned by Edward IV, and his death later
					that year. Roger had been one of the leaders of the Lancastrian
					cause in north Wales during the 1460s. Guto mentions ‘toilsome
					years’ and the price Roger had to pay; whether this refers to his
					maintenance of the Lancastrian military effort or the cost of
					purchasing the king’s, and perhaps also Herbert’s, favour, Guto
					does not tell us.</p>
				<p>Two other poems belong to the few months between the triumph
					of the Herbert brothers and their fall in July 1469. One of them
					(poem 23) describes Herbert as an earl. He had gone to Gloucester
					to settle some dispute there, doubtless on behalf of Edward IV; it
					is noteworthy that Guto’s subsequent elegy for Herbert should refer
					to enmity between Herbert and the men of Gloucester. By now Herbert
					had moved on to London, and the poet worries for his safety among
					the treacherous English. Modern readers may feel this poem to be
					prophetic, but there is no way that Guto could have foreseen the
					events of the summer of 1469, and it is mere romancing to attribute
					the poem to a time when Herbert had departed on the fateful
					campaign of Banbury: Herbert is in London, not facing rebels in the
					English midlands. The second poem of this period is addressed to
					Richard Herbert (poem 22). It praises the ambitious building work
					he undertook at Coldbrook, his home near Abergavenny. Once again,
					it is hard for us to read about this lavish expenditure without
					recalling that within a very short time Richard would be laying his
					head on the block. The date of this poem is assured because, like
					the previous one, it refers to William Herbert as an earl.</p>

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">2.6 </span><span class="head">The
						battle of Edgecote (Banbury), 1469</span>
				</h4>
				<p>In July 1469 the extraordinary career of Wiliam Herbert came
					to a sudden and violent end. A rebellion broke out in the north of
					England. Though its leader was one ‘Robin of Redesdale’, it is
					clear that Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, and George, duke of
					Clarence, were the real instigators. Edward IV went north to face
					the rebels, summoning Herbert from south Wales and Humphrey
					Stafford, earl of Devon, from south-west England to join him.
					Edward became isolated at Nottingham, but the rebels passed him by.
					On 24 July they encountered William Herbert’s army near Edgecote, a
					village in Northamptonshire close to Banbury. Humphrey Stafford was
					apparently never present or else he fled during the battle.
					Herbert’s forces were overwhelmed and he and his brother were
					captured. They were removed to Northampton where they were
					condemned to death by Warwick and Clarence. Richard Herbert was
					beheaded on 26 July and his brother likewise the following day. A
					codicil to his will that Herbert wrote that morning is still
					extant.</p>
				<p>The effect of these events on the coterie of poets who had
					assembled around Herbert during his years of ascendancy was
					devastating. Guto’r Glyn was one so affected. His response was the
					elegy edited as poem 24, composed a few months afterwards (it
					mentions the death of Humphrey Stafford at Bridgwater in Somerset
					on 17 August). Without a doubt it is one of the most powerful
					elegies in the Welsh language. It opens by comparing the fall of
					the Herberts to the dance of death, a devotional image that had
					recently reached Britain from the Continent. It continues,
					lamenting the fact that an axe blade had now touched the neck that
					once had worn a golden collar. The classical three Fates are blamed
					for cutting the life-thread of this earl. The poet yearns to see
					vengeance done on the English for this disaster. Nothing remains
					for him now other than to yield to madness and wander the forests
					like the wild man Merlin. Yet the poem ends with a hint of hope, as
					the poet remembers that the sons of the dead earl, along with his
					half-brother, Sir Roger Vaughan of Tretower, are still alive to
					protect the land.</p>

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">3.1 </span><span class="head">The
						1470s</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Guto’s dealings with the Herberts did not come to an end with the
					death of William Herbert. In fact, he continued to work for members
					of the family well into the 1470s. The first of these, perhaps, was
					William Herbert’s son, also William Herbert, second earl of
					Pembroke. A <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of
					praise for him may belong to the winter of 1471/2 (poem 25). It
					urges him to take vengeance for the death of his father in 1469 and
					that of his uncle, Sir Roger Vaughan, in May 1471. In this poem
					there is both stern political advice and firm moral counsels
					regarding the fitting way for a young nobleman like William to
					behave – not, in Guto’s view, by exhibiting pride bordering on
					arrogance, but rather by following the example of his father. It
					would be interesting to know what the young William Herbert thought
					about this advice, given that he was son and heir of one of the
					most single-mindedly self-promoting Welsh landowners of his age. In
					any event, the authority of the second earl of Pembroke was to fade
					over the course of the decade, along with his influence at court.
				</p>
				<p>Another poem from roughly the same time is the one for the
					young earl’s mother, Ann Herbert, wife of the first earl (poem 26).
					It is mainly a poem of consolation, and is one of the few works
					that Guto composed directly for a female patron; even so, her son
					receives considerable attention within it, being portrayed as the
					ideal successor to his father. The second earl is mentioned also in
					another poem from the early 1470s, a praise poem for his older
					half-brother, William Herbert of Pembroke and Troy (poem 28). This
					latter William Herbert was an illegitimate son of the first earl.
					Both he and his half-brother, the second earl, are praised as
					worthy heirs to their father; indeed, Guto insists that William
					Herbert of Pembroke and Troy looked the spitting image of the first
					earl. His loyalty to his legitimate brother is also stressed.
					William was treasurer and steward of the earldom of Pembroke while
					his father was alive, and he probably lived there for the most
					part. Though Guto names places in the Pembroke area, it is quite
					possible that the poem was performed at one of the Herbert seats in
					Gwent.</p>
				<p>A notable poem that may have been commissioned by the
					Herberts is the praise of Edward IV (poem 29). The internal
					evidence suggests that it was performed between 1473 and 1475,
					possibly in the presence of the second earl and during the king’s
					visit to Shrewsbury in June 1473. If so, the poem may be taken as
					an attempt by William Herbert to regain the favour of the king,
					indeed as a statement of loyalty to Edward at a time when Herbert
					influence was in decline. The poem is an interesting combination of
					traditional prophetic themes, including crusade to the Holy Land,
					together with a more direct appeal to the king to meet the needs of
					Wales as regards order, law and religion.</p>
				<p>If Guto did indeed perform this poem in front of the king in
					Shrewsbury in 1473, he may have sung for others in and around
					north-east Wales at around this time. A few miles south-east of
					Oswestry lay the home of Sir Roger Kynaston of Knockin, whose
					praises Guto sang soon after May 1471, when Roger was knighted on
					the battlefield of Tewkesbury (poem 79). This honour is mentioned
					by Guto, as well as the fact that Roger Kynaston had earlier fought
					at Barnet in April 1471, where Richard, earl of Warwick, was
					defeated (indeed, it is possible that it was Roger who killed him).
					The poet makes much of Kynaston’s loyalty to Edward even after the
					king was forced to flee to the Continent in 1470, and explains
					cheekily that he has waited until Kynaston was knighted before
					singing his praises.</p>
				<p>
					Another patron whom Guto most likely visited in the first half of
					the 1470s was Syr Siôn Mechain, rector of Llandrinio, a few miles
					south of Knockin. Two of Guto’s praise poems for him survive. One
					of them (poem 84) is a lively piece in which Guto refers to two of
					his other patrons in that part of the world who were now deceased,
					Dafydd Cyffin of Llangedwyn and Sir Benet, rector of Corwen; the
					poetry addressed to both has been discussed above. Siôn would
					undoubtedly have known these two men. Now, Guto insists, it is Siôn
					who fills the gap they have left behind. He asks here a question
					that may be seen in various forms in other poems of the poet’s old
					age: <span style="font-style: italic">Pwy a’m pyrth, o syrth
						oes hen?</span> (‘Who will aid me, if old age descends?’, 84.51). Guto
					certainly received patronage from Siôn on more than one occasion,
					for he also composed a praise poem in honour of the rector’s new
					house in Llandrinio (poem 85). In the opening lines Guto reveals an
					awareness of the work of his predecessor, Iolo Goch, recalling the
					patronage that Iolo received from Ithel ap Robert of Coedymynydd in
					Flintshire, while in conclusion he blesses the house, just as he
					had done for the newly rebuilt Moeliwrch early in his career (poem
					90).
				</p>
				<p>
					North of Llandrinio and west of Oswestry lay the lordship of Chirk,
					of which Sieffrai Cyffin was steward in 1475. Guto had already sung
					his praises at the beginning of the 1460s when Sieffrai was
					constable of Oswestry castle and Guto himself a burgess in the
					town, but now Sieffrai was pursuing a legal career, though he still
					continued to offer patronage to Guto. It may have been around 1475
					that Guto composed his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					asking Sieffrai to give a hunting horn to Siôn Eutun of Parc Eutun
					south of Wrexham (poem 99). It is full of inventive metaphors and
					was very popular indeed among copyists – in fact, the earliest copy
					is in the hand of the poet Hywel Dafi. Guto tells us that Sieffrai
					not only excelled at law but was also proficient in <span
						style="font-style: italic">cerdd dafod</span>, the traditional art
					of Welsh verse. Another poem that may date from around this time is
					the <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> asking Robert ab
					Ieuan Fychan of Coetmor in Arllechwedd to give two hunting dogs to
					Sieffrai Cyffin (poem 100). Apart from its masterly descriptions of
					the dogs, the poem is noteworthy as a commentary upon the
					conventions of request poetry at the time. It praises Sieffrai for
					not requesting a major gift such as a horse or an ox, and his
					choice of smaller animals such as birds and dogs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Maelor Saesneg south-east of Wrexham was the home of Siôn Hanmer
					of Halghton (d. 1480), who may have patronized Guto on two
					occasions in the 1470s. Siôn was a nephew of Owain Glyndŵr, a fact
					which Guto notes in his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					of praise (poem 75). It was on Siôn’s behalf that Guto composed his
					poem to request a hunting knife from Gruffudd ap Rhys of Yale. It
					describes the knife in a series of elegant metaphors, mentioning
					also two smaller, companion knives that resided in the same sheath,
					‘daughters’ to their larger ‘mother’ (poem 76).
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the latest poems that Guto composed for a southern patron
					links two border regions where Guto was very active in the 1470s,
					namely Powys and Gwent. Walter Herbert was a son of William
					Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, and younger brother of the second
					earl. Where he was living when Guto composed for him is unclear.
					Like the rest of his family, he would surely have had a residence
					somewhere in Gwent, but the poem makes much of Walter’s connections
					with Powys and was most likely performed there (poem 27). The
					lordship of Powys was placed in the Herberts’ care in 1467, the
					heir being underage, and would seem still to have been under their
					control when Guto praised Walter Herbert <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1475. The Herberts’ relations
					with the king had deteriorated by 1478 at the latest, and it seems
					that Guto distanced himself from his Herbert patrons at this time
					as well. Old age and the resulting need to limit his bardic
					circuits probably account for this, but it may not be a coincidence
					that Guto’s involvement with the Herberts came to an end just at
					this difficult time in the family’s history when they had lost
					political favour. The poem for Walter Herbert is Guto’s last
					surviving work for any member of the family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guto ceased to visit centres of patronage in Gwent by <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1475. His last southern poem
					may be one that belongs to the Golden Valley of Herefordshire. It
					was there that he returned to sing an elegy for one of his oldest
					patrons, Henry Griffith of Newcourt (poem 36), who died in 1476 or
					1477. It will be recalled that he and Guto were contemporaries who
					had fought together, feasted together and, perhaps, practised feats
					such as stone-throwing together since the 1430s, and there must
					have been more than mere platitudes to the grief that Guto
					expresses in his elegy. There is also a hint of guilty feeling in
					the retraction that Guto makes of his criticisms of Henry
					Griffith’s miserly conduct (cf. poem 35); were the two never
					reconciled before Henry died? This poem closes the door on Guto’s
					long and distinguished involvement with patron houses in south, and
					especially south-eastern, Wales. It is not likely that he ever
					returned to south Wales, and with very few exceptions his patrons
					from the later 1470s onwards were exclusively northern.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although no poems can be assigned to a certain date in the second
					half of the 1470s, we do possess a most interesting record of
					Guto’s activity as a poet in Shrewsbury in 1476–7 and again in
					1477–8. Both Guto and a man called <span style="font-style: italic">Walter
						Harper</span> (his harpist, undoubtedly) are described as <span
						style="font-style: italic">ministral[es] principis</span>
					‘minstrels to the prince’ in the bailiffs’ accounts for the town on
					two separate occasions during those years (Harper 2013: 185).
					Neither the precise significance of the term nor the nature of the
					occasions is clear, but it seems that Guto and Walter (?Gwallter)
					did perform in front of Edward, Prince of Wales, who was King
					Edward IV’s eldest son (born 1470). There is no way of knowing what
					poems Guto performed for him, whether they were specially
					commissioned or already in existence (one such might have been the
					poem of praise for the prince’s father, Edward IV). In any event,
					the record is an indication of Guto’s prominence as a poet as well
					as his enterprise in finding new sources of patronage. It is worth
					remembering that the chief councillor to the young prince was his
					uncle, Anthony Woodville, a learned man and poet who visited
					Renaissance Italy, while the prince’s chamberlain, Sir Thomas
					Vaughan of Monmouth, was of Welsh descent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before we leave the 1470s, we should take note of three poems which
					indicate that Guto was still active in the north-west as well. None
					of them can be dated with much accuracy, but their strict metrical
					craftsmanship and some references in them are consistent with the
					1470s. In terms of <span style="font-style: italic">cynghanedd</span>,
					the poets of the fifteenth century gradually made more frequent use
					of consonantal types of <span style="font-style: italic">cynghanedd</span>,
					and less use of the <span style="font-style: italic">cynghanedd
						sain</span>. As the century progressed, the poems became generally
					stricter (LlU 99–100). The <span style="font-style: italic">cynghanedd</span>
					is particularly strict in the elegy for Hywel ab Owain of
					Llanbryn-mair, who was a cousin on his mother’s side of Sieffrai
					Cyffin of Oswestry and, like Sieffrai, was trained in <span
						style="font-style: italic">cerdd dafod</span> (poem 40). Another
					elegy showing similar metrical technique is the one for Meurig
					Fychan ap Hywel Selau and Angharad daughter of Dafydd of Nannau
					near Dolgellau (poem 50); this married couple had patronized Guto
					during the 1460s. Like another couple elegized by Guto, Dafydd
					Llwyd ap Gruffudd and Catrin daughter of Dafydd of Abertanad,
					Meurig Fychan and Angharad seem to have fallen victim to the
					plague. They were interred together at Cymer abbey. But this elegy
					for the lord and lady of Nannau lacks the intense grief expressed
					in the Abertanad elegy, most probably because they lived to a ripe
					age and left behind adult children. The poem does not mention the
					heir, Dafydd ap Meurig Fychan, but another poem survives which
					thanks him and his wife, Elen daughter of Hywel, for the gift of a
					horse (poem 51). Apparently Dafydd had heard that Guto had lost his
					black horse and sent him a new one, one that could trot as well as
					gallop and was suitable to carry a blind man such as the poet now
					was. Though Dafydd was the donor, the last line praises Elen for
					urging her husband to make the gift. The poem is less strict in its
					metrical technique than the elegy for Dafydd’s parents, a feature
					that could suggest an early date, yet the talk of blindness looks
					forward to the numerous references to the poet’s loss of his sight
					that are scattered through his verse in the 1480s. At the end of
					the poem Guto contemplates the possibility of spending his final
					years in ‘the house of St Bernard’, perhaps Cymer abbey, which
					stands close to Nannau. Clearly by the end of the decade Guto was
					beginning to foresee a time when old age would force him to stay in
					one place. It would, however, be a different abbey that ultimately
					offered him a home.

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">3.2 </span><span class="head">The
						1480s</span>
				</h4>
				<p>The earliest definitely datable poem of the 1480s is an
					elegy. Soon after the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, two of
					Guto’s northern patrons, Wiliam Fychan ap Gwilym of Penrhyn near
					Bangor and Gruffudd Fychan ap Gruffudd of Corsygedol south of
					Harlech, also died. Guto’s elegy for the latter (poem 52) opens
					with a lament for all three deaths; the numerous references to
					places in the Dee valley suggest that it was performed in the home
					of Gruffudd’s brother Elisau in Gwyddelwern rather than at
					Corsygedol itself. Guto seems to have been on circuit in the
					north-east towards the end of 1483 and early in 1484, since it was
					sometime during those months that he praised Tomas Salbri ap Harri
					Salbri of Lleweni near Denbigh (poem 71). Tomas (d. 1490) was an
					old man at the time, and the poem pays much attention to his wife
					and their ten children, especially to the younger Tomas Salbri and
					a daughter, Elsbeth. These two were named after their parents.
					Though Guto plays exuberantly and with great metrical ingenuity on
					the figure ten at the end of the poem, nevertheless the work as a
					whole has a thoroughly professional feel and maintains a certain
					distance from its patrons. In this regard it is quite different
					from others which belong to this later period in the poet’s life,
					though another comparable example, and one which may belong to the
					same bardic circuit, is the praise of Syr Hywel ap Dai of Northop
					south of Flint, in which the patron is referred to throughout in
					the third person (poem 70).</p>
				<p>After the death of Edward IV his younger brother seized the
					throne on 6 July as Richard III. Edward IV’s rightful heir, the
					young Prince of Wales for whom Guto had performed in Shrewsbury
					between 1476 and 1478, was imprisoned by his uncle in the Tower of
					London. There he and his younger brother Richard were, in all
					likelihood, murdered on the orders of Richard III, sometime around
					the late summer of 1483. Richard was not king for long. Though he
					managed to put down a revolt that broke out in autumn 1483, support
					continued to grow for the sole remaining representative of the
					Lancastrian cause, a man who was aiming at the throne but who had
					been living in exile in Brittany since 1471 – Henry Tudor. Henry
					returned to Britain in the summer of 1485. He landed near Milford
					Haven and proceeded through Wales to Bosworth Field in the English
					Midlands. There on 22 August he defeated the forces of the king.
					Richard was killed on the battlefield, and Henry (VII) was then
					acclaimed on the spot.</p>
				<p>
					At least three of Guto’s patrons fought at Bosworth. Sir Rhys ap
					Thomas of Abermarlais in the Tywi valley was one of Henry Tudor’s
					chief representatives in Wales. He was knighted three days after
					the battle of Bosworth. Guto’s poem in his praise was composed soon
					after the victory (poem 14), and its interesting reference to <span
						style="font-style: italic">lladd y baedd</span> – &#x90;’the
					killing of the boar’, that is, Richard III – may lend credence to
					the idea that it was Rhys’s men who killed him. Since Guto appears
					to have abandoned his bardic circuits to south Wales some time
					before 1485/6, the poem was probably conveyed to Abermarlais and
					performed in front of Rhys by a <span style="font-style: italic">datgeiniad</span>
					or reciter. Another possibility is that the poem is wrongly
					attributed to Guto, since the manuscript attribution is not beyond
					question. Yet it is not impossible that Guto had been associated
					with Rhys even before Bosworth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Siôn Edward of Plasnewydd in Chirkland seems to have fought at
					Bosworth in the forces of Sir William Stanley. Stanley had been a
					strong Yorkist supporter for most of his career, but changed his
					colours in 1485, perhaps unconvinced of the legitimacy of Richard
					III’s rule, and supported Henry Tudor instead. At Bosworth he
					remained on the sidelines of the battle. Only at the last moment
					did he direct his forces to intervene against the king. According
					to Guto, Siôn took a good deal of time to return home from the
					battlefield: his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of
					praise celebrating the homecoming notes that two months had elapsed
					(poem 107). The poem’s air of intimacy, the praise for Siôn’s wife,
					Gwenhwyfar daughter of Elis Eutun, together with the praise for
					Siôn’s patronage that we encounter in other poems, all combine to
					show clearly that Guto had performed for the couple before and knew
					them well. We encounter here too the image of the poet as an archer
					aiming arrows of praise at his patron, an image used extensively by
					the poet earlier in his career. This poem for Siôn portrays a
					friendship between poet and patron over and above a purely
					professional relationship.
				</p>
				<p>The same is true of other poems composed in the same personal
					vein at around this time, only these were for Gwynedd patrons. The
					third of the men who fought for Henry Tudor at Bosworth was Wiliam
					ap Gruffudd of Cochwillan in the Ogwen valley. His reward for his
					service was to be appointed sheriff of Caernarfonshire for life on
					24 September 1485, and Guto did indeed address him as sheriff soon
					afterwards (poem 55). Wiliam is praised for his valour, his
					generosity and his appearance, especially his long white hair,
					contrasted subtly with the poet’s baldness. Guto clearly felt very
					much at home at Cochwillan, indeed he insists that he will not
					leave until his dying day. Such statements were generally
					stereotypical, but this instance seems slightly more believable
					than most and the same can be said for the ending of the poem of
					thanks for a horse which Guto composed for Dafydd ap Meurig Fychan
					of Nannau (poem 51).</p>
				<p>
					It looks as though Guto headed north-westwards at the beginning of
					1485 to perform for one of his old patrons in Anglesey. In winter
					1484, while Henry Tudor was still in France and Richard III still
					trying to strengthen his grip on the throne, Guto was in the
					cantref of Penllyn when he heard that Huw Lewys of Prysaeddfed had
					suffered an accident (poem 64). Around the beginning of December,
					so it appears, Huw fell off his horse while trying to cross the
					dangerous Malltraeth marsh on the island. Huw and his brothers had
					been the object of earlier praise by Guto, possibly in the 1460s
					(poem 63). Two of the brothers had passed away in the meantime,
					leaving the oldest, Meurig, and the youngest, Rhys, together with
					Huw himself. Just as he had done at the time when Hywel ab Ieuan
					Fychan of Moeliwrch injured his knee (see poem 92), Guto expresses
					his sympathy for Huw by declaring that he is himself prostrate on
					account of Huw’s accident. Unlike the poem for Hywel, however, Guto
					pushes his imagery to extremes here. He declares that he has
					himself suffered virtually the same accident as Huw, since the
					tears he and others shed for his patron were so numerous as to form
					a sea in which the poet all but drowned. This extreme empathy seems
					to have irked a wandering poet who was active in Gwynedd at the
					time, namely Llywelyn ap Gutun. Llywelyn, from Melverley near
					Welshpool, was both poet and harpist, and furthermore a rather
					tempestuous individual. In what was very probably part of the
					Christmas celebrations of 1484 at Llwydiarth in Anglesey, Llywelyn
					conjured up the scenario that Guto himself had drowned at
					Malltraeth (poem 65a). Guto’s body is described, submerged beneath
					the waves – his corpse is full of mackerel, cod and eels – and then
					the adventures of his troubled ghost on dry land. Our poet
					responded to Llywelyn’s satire in March 1485, so far as we can
					tell. His own humorous satire against Llywelyn ap Gutun accuses the
					latter of becoming roaring drunk at the expense of Huw Lewys and
					his relative Cynwrig ap Dafydd and of being quite inebriated when
					he imagined the whole story of Guto’s drowning (poem 65). This
					accusation was a neat tactic, for it both made a fool of Llywelyn
					and at the same time indirectly praised the generosity of the
					patrons, which of course had been the point of the original <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> in honour of Huw Lewys
					that set off the whole incident.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is evident that Guto was dividing his time between Gwynedd and
					the north-east from <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1480
					until at least the end of 1485. It was not just secular patrons
					whose hospitality enticed him to these two areas. There was also
					extensive patronage available from two of the most prominent
					clerical patrons of the age, Rhisiart Cyffin, dean of Bangor, and
					Abbot Dafydd ab Ieuan of Valle Crucis.
				</p>

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">3.3 </span><span class="head">Rhisiart
						Cyffin, dean of Bangor</span>
				</h4>
				<p>Rhisiart Cyffin ab Ieuan Llwyd was appointed dean of Bangor
					sometime between 1472 and 1478. Some of Guto’s verse for him may
					date to the 1470s. He was a cousin of Wiliam ap Gruffudd of
					Cochwillan and belonged therefore to one of the most influential
					families in Gwynedd, as well as being a supporter of Henry Tudor.
					He was dean of Bangor throughout the 1480s and was an exceptionally
					generous patron towards at least seven poets. None of the six poems
					Guto’r Glyn composed for him can be precisely dated, and it is
					notable that none is a straight praise poem. Instead Guto praised
					the dean through other genres, notably in poems of request and
					gratitude for gifts.</p>
				<p>
					Though Rhisiart was a cleric by profession, as a bardic patron he
					behaved in the manner any secular patron would have done,
					exchanging gifts with his poet and with relations near and far. Huw
					Bulkeley ap William Bulkeley of Beaumaris was a second cousin of
					his, and on Huw’s behalf Guto requested a falcon from Rhisiart
					(poem 60). At the time Huw was deputy constable of Conwy castle, an
					office he held from 1482 onwards. Another <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> asking Rhisiart for a
					gift is the one on behalf of Sir Gruffudd ab Einion of Henllan near
					Dinbych, who was also claimed as a relative of the dean (poem 61).
					Sir Gruffudd wished to replace the thatched roof of his home with
					slates from Snowdonia, and Guto is certain that Rhisiart will be
					willing to send them by sea from Bangor to the estuary of the Clwyd
					and then upstream to Henllan. The poem offers a valuable glimpse of
					the beginning of the slate industry in Gwynedd.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guto composed two poems expressing gratitude to Rhisiart Cyffin in
					exchange for two personal gifts, one a purse and the other a
					rosary. The poem about the purse has more to say about the donor
					than the gift itself (poem 58). In places it echoes a poem of
					thanks for another purse that Guto received from Catrin daughter of
					Maredudd of Abertanad some two decades earlier (poem 87); in that
					work the gift is lavishly described. The poem in gratitude for the
					rosary, a string of twelve beads used to count prayers addressed to
					the Virgin Mary, differs in its emphasis from the purse poem, for
					it does contain many inventive descriptions of the gift (poem 59).
					Furthermore, while the purse poem lauds the material quality of the
					gift, the praise for the rosary ends with the poet yearning to
					become a hermit. This poem ends with a prayer for long life for
					Rhisiart Cyffin, very much in the spirit of the <span
						style="font-style: italic">genre</span>, but the rosary poem is
					much more introspective – another sign, perhaps, that Guto’s mind
					was on withdrawal from the world.
				</p>
				<p>If Guto was hoping to find shelter in Bangor during his last
					days, he made no direct mention of it in his poems. It was to the
					Dee valley, and especially to the abbey of Valle Crucis, that he
					turned in the end. Two poems are extant which reveal how Guto’s
					professional work forged a link for him between Bangor and Valle
					Crucis. The first is a poem requesting two oxen from each of four
					patrons in north-east Wales; all eight animals were to be given to
					Rhisiart Cyffin (poem 108). In the case of two of these men, no
					other poems addressed to them by Guto survive: these are Dafydd
					Llwyd ap Tudur of Bodidris and Siôn Trefor of Pentrecynfrig. It is
					likely, though, that a substantial body of work addressed to the
					latter has been lost. Of the remaining two, one was Siôn Edward of
					Plasnewydd, praised after Bosworth, and the other was Abbot Dafydd
					ab Ieuan of Valle Crucis, whose relations with Guto’r Glyn will be
					discussed below. The second poem which links Bangor and Valle
					Crucis may reveal why Guto chose to retire there (poem 109). In it
					he tells us that he fell and broke three ribs. The accident
					happened near the abbey and forced him to seek medical care there.
					But Rhisiart Cyffin heard of his plight and sent him a kiss from
					Bangor which was to be delivered by the lips of Abbot Dafydd, who
					was then visiting Bangor, or so it seems. Though Guto did
					apparently recover, the accident must have put paid to any thoughts
					of circuiting far from Valle Crucis for some time.</p>

				<h4>
					<span class="headingNumber">3.4 </span><span class="head">Abbot
						Dafydd ab Ieuan</span>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Dafydd ab Ieuan was appointed abbot of the Cistercian house of
					Valle Crucis <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1480,
					succeeding another man who had extended patronage to Guto, Siôn ap
					Rhisiart. In contrast to Guto’s verse for Siôn, however, which has
					entirely disappeared, the manuscripts preserve a rich body of
					poetry composed in honour of Abbot Dafydd. Some of these works are
					considered to be among the best that Guto’r Glyn composed. As we
					saw was the case with the Rhisiart Cyffin poems, it is difficult to
					date any of the poems addressed to Dafydd ab Ieuan with precision,
					though the likelihood is that Guto was receiving patronage from the
					abbot throughout the 1480s. There are indeed points of resemblance
					between Rhisiart Cyffin and Abbot Dafydd. Both were probably
					conceived outside wedlock and both had to seek papal permission to
					hold clerical office. Both were also keen supporters of Henry
					Tudor. It was Dafydd who was commissioned by Henry VII in 1485 to
					be in charge of establishing the king’s Welsh lineage. Finally,
					both men were exceptionally generous to Guto’r Glyn in his old age.
					This generosity was enough to incite the envy of other poets. Syr
					Siôn Leiaf (son of the Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf who satirized Guto
					in poem 93) composed a praise poem for Rhisiart Cyffin in Bangor
					which includes open satire of Guto’r Glyn, Hywel Grythor and
					Gwerful Mechain (Salisbury 2011: 101–3). Ieuan accused his
					fellow-poets of taking advantage of Rhisiart Cyffin’s generosity by
					feasting too extensively at his home in Bangor. Guto refers to this
					dispute in a poem relating to another, similar accusation against
					him, this time at Valle Crucis (poem 116). Three poets, so he
					claims, have challenged his right to enjoy the patronage of Abbot
					Dafydd there: Maredudd ap Rhys, Gruffudd ap Dafydd (a relative of
					Guto, according to the poem) and Edward ap Dafydd. Guto’s defence
					of his place at the abbey is masterly: however blind he may be, and
					however weak his body, his poetic inspiration (<span
						style="font-style: italic">awen</span>) is still strong enough to
					defeat the feeble verse of his fellow-poets, even if they stem from
					a better lineage than he does.
				</p>
				<p>
					And in Valle Crucis he stayed, circuiting the local area and
					returning frequently (especially over winter) to praise Abbot
					Dafydd in more than one <span style="font-style: italic">genre</span>
					of poem. His poem asking Trahaearn ab Ieuan of Pen-rhos near
					Caerleon for a loan of the ‘Book of the Grail’ (poem 114) was
					composed on behalf of the abbot. The very book in question has
					survived to the present day: it is Peniarth 11, a copy of a Welsh
					translation of some French Grail stories. By his own admission Guto
					was old and blind by the time he came to make this request, and it
					is unlikely that he voiced it himself in front of Trahaearn (which
					does not exclude the possibility that he had worked for Trahaearn
					in the past). More probably the poem was performed for him by a <span
						style="font-style: italic">datgeiniad</span> or professional
					reciter, either at Trahaearn’s home in Pen-rhos or some other
					residence of his near Haverfordwest. Another of Guto’s works in
					honour of the abbot was his <span style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span>
					thanking him for a buckler, a kind of small, round shield, perhaps
					performed at the abbot’s home in Trefor (poem 110). The buckler was
					a personal gift which Guto intended to offer up to the abbey
					(together with a short sword) when he died, in the hope that the
					weapons would be depicted in stone on his grave. It is an echo of
					his earlier days serving the duke of York as a soldier in 1441, and
					a strong indication that Guto wished to be remembered as a soldier
					as well as a poet (see further Day 2013: 256, 280–1). A poem which
					Guto composed for another abbot, Dafydd ab Owain of Strata Marcella
					(poem 115), was either commissioned by Abbot Dafydd of Valle Crucis
					or arose through Guto’s connections with him. This is one of only
					two poems by Guto relating to Strata Marcella (the other is poem
					82, the elegy for Llywelyn ab y Moel who was buried there in 1440),
					and it is certain that many others have been lost. Dafydd ab Owain
					is praised for his gifts as a husbandman and especially for the
					horses that he bred. The poem closes by wishing to see Dafydd ab
					Owain raised to a bishopric; he was indeed to receive that honour,
					becoming bishop of St Asaph in 1503.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides these occasional poems, Guto composed three straight praise
					poems for Dafydd ab Ieuan of Valle Crucis. One of them is a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> (poem 112). It devotes
					much attention to the abbot’s work in rebuilding and repairing the
					abbey. The picture it paints of the flourishing life of the abbey
					is a happy one: its storerooms are full of corn and its buildings
					have been reroofed with oak timber from nearby Bron Hyrddin. The
					other two poems are similar in tone. Both are very skilfully
					wrought odes (<span style="font-style: italic">awdlau</span>), and
					clearly show that old age had in no way impaired Guto’s ability to
					compose in such an intricate style. One (poem 111) probably dates
					to his early days as the abbey’s poet. It praises Dafydd ab Ieuan
					as the ideal abbot, while expressing the poet’s intent to settle in
					the abbey at the end of his life. In contrast to the similar wishes
					expressed in poems for other patrons, the poet’s desire – ‘I will
					come there to my cherished land … I will lie amongst its roots’
					(111.62, 64) – was realized this time. No doubt Guto had already
					received the abbot’s promise in this regard. The same wish is
					repeated in the other ode (poem 113), but this one is much more
					focused on the life of the abbey and on the talents of Abbot Dafydd
					especially. The poet mentions the orchards, woods and bee gardens,
					alongside the abbot’s physical strength and his particular interest
					in the arts of poetry and the harp.
				</p>
				<p>
					There remain two other poems for Dafydd ab Ieuan, both among Guto’s
					very latest works. One (poem 117) is a <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of praise which is famous
					for its opening lines: ‘Where are the old men? Have they passed
					away? / Tonight I am the very oldest.’ The rest of the poem, if not
					quite as melancholy as this, is nevertheless in the same vein. The
					poet admits that his bardic circuit has shrunk, though he is not
					yet wholly confined within the walls of the abbey:
				</p>
				<p class="cefndir">Clera Môn, cael aur a medd,<br/>
				Gynt a gawn, Gwent a Gwynedd;<br/>
				Clera’n nes, cael aur a wnaf,<br/>
				Yma ‘n Iâl, am na welaf.</p>
				<p class="cefndir">
					<span style="font-style: italic">Once I used to be able to
						go on a bardic circuit to Anglesey, / I would receive gold and
						mead, I would go on a circuit to Gwent and Gwynedd; / now my
						circuit is closer to home, I receive gold / here in Yale, because
						I cannot see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					He names three other patrons alongside Abbot Dafydd. These three
					keep him from despair in his old age: Siôn Trefor of Pentrecynfrig,
					Siôn Edward of Plasnewydd and Dafydd Llwyd ap Tudur of Bodidris.
					Here are the self-same four patrons from whom Guto requested eight
					oxen on behalf of Rhisiart Cyffin in poem 109. The other <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> is not so well known, but
					if anything it is even more significant (poem 118). It was sung in
					answer to a request by Abbot Dafydd: ‘He asked of me, and commanded
					it, to glorify God before man<span style="font-style: italic">.’
					</span>All his life Guto had been a master of the praise of men; now, in
					his last years, his patron was reminding him that he should rather
					sing the praises of God in order to prepare his soul for the next
					world. Of course, there is praise of Dafydd himself for making the
					suggestion, but most of the poem is indeed given over to God,
					something which is otherwise extremely rare in this poet’s work.
					Guto contemplates his own old age, the mystery of the Trinity,
					Christ and creation, before focusing on the death of Christ and his
					own impending end. He reaches the conclusion that his task must now
					be to repent and worship God, in the hope that he will later find a
					berth in heaven.
				</p>
				<p>
					This reflective poem may well be the last of Guto’s surviving
					works. He was probably at Valle Crucis when he composed two elegiac
					stanzas for fellow-poets, Dafydd Nanmor and Ieuan Deulwyn, who died
					sometime between <span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1485 and
					<span style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1490 (poem 54). These
					stanzas are the only evidence that he knew either man, both of whom
					were apparently interred at the Cistercian house of Whitland in
					Carmarthenshire. As with some other poems of the time, they may
					well have been conveyed southwards by a professional reciter.
					Another stanza which belongs to the end of the poet’s life is poem
					119, lamenting the troubles of old age:
				</p>
				<p class="cefndir">Gwae’r gwan dau oedran nid edrych, – ni
					chwardd,<br/>
				Ni cherdda led y rhych,<br/>
				Gwae ni wŷl yn gynilwych,<br/>
				Gwae ni chlyw organ a chlych!</p>
				<p class="cefndir">
					<span style="font-style: italic">Woe to the weak man, two
						lifetimes old, who doesn’t look, – who doesn’t laugh, / who
						doesn’t walk further than the furrow’s width, / woe to him who
						doesn’t see distinctly, / woe to him who doesn’t hear an organ and
						bells!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					A note in the hand of Thomas Wiliems (1590s) next to a copy of this
					stanza tells us that Guto failed to attend Mass at the abbey
					because he slept through the noise of bells and organ. On awakening
					and realizing his error, the blind old poet seems to have
					blunderingly interrupted the service. The account is strongly
					reminiscent of Guto’s own description of himself in his <span
						style="font-style: italic">cywydd</span> of praise for Abbot
					Dafydd, where he notes how laboriously the monks had to look after
					him in his decrepitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guto’s last years at Valle Crucis may have been in the status of a
					corrodian, someone who had secured a place for himself in an abbey
					during his old age, either through payment or in recompense for
					past service (Bowen 1995: 153–6). Alternatively, he may have been a
					kind of poet-in-residence. Whatever the formal arrangement, the
					monks may have had little say in the matter: in Abbot Dafydd Guto
					had found a patron willing to sustain him for the rest of his life.
					The sheer variety of the verse composed in honour of Dafydd
					reflects the close relationship between the two men. There is
					poetry of request and gratitude as well as all kinds of praise,
					sung in various metres and involving many different themes not
					often encountered in such works, including challenges issued to
					other poets and intense religious verse. There is a pleasing
					symmetry in seeing Guto’r Glyn spending his last years under the
					care of Abbot Dafydd at Valle Crucis, given that his early career
					was so strongly supported by another abbot, Rhys of Strata Florida.
					The two abbots enjoyed very different fates, one dying a debtor in
					prison, the other successful to the point of achieving a bishopric
					before he died. We do not know for sure when Guto’r Glyn himself
					died, but it is not likely to be far distant from <span
						style="font-style: italic">c</span>.1490, he being some eighty
					years old at the time. Having sustained Guto’s muse when he was
					alive, Abbot Dafydd performed a final service for him by acting as
					patron for his elegy, sung at the abbey by Gutun Owain (poem 126).
					Guto’r Glyn was buried, according to his own wishes, in the soil of
					Valle Crucis.
